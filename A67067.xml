            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEing bound by many Obligations and Ties of love and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to ſerve you as a Chriſtian in what I am able, I knew not wherein I could better expreſs it (wherein I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be ſerviceable to you) then in preſenting you with this Piece; the Lines of which have been in part the fruit of my Priſon Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: Wherein, as in a Glaſs, you may ſee, to your great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the wonderful glory of Chriſt which lay hid under the aſhes of thoſe Jewiſh Types; the which when duly read and inquired into, ſhew you the bleſſed ſtatue or repreſentation of Chriſts Church, together with the hidden work of Chriſt intrinſecally wrought by him in the minds of his dear Children upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, the thoughts of which hath made me deeply to bewail the loſs that ſome weak Chriſtians have ſuſtained, who out of ignorance and blind conceitedneſs of mind, ſlight the reading of the Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> becauſe (as they ſay) it is the Law, who judge that the Law in no ſenſe hath any thing to do with them, or they with it; and as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Timothy, 1 Tim. 1. 7.</hi> They (in ſpeaking of the Law) underſtand not what they ſay, neither indeed what they affirm. I do not ſay the Ceremonial Law is any way binding to us, I am ſo little either a Jew or Papiſt, but I ſay it is inſtructive to us, having the Goſpel to compare therewith, ſo ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Gal. 3.</hi> 24. And the more we read it and peruſe it, the more we ſee into the Goſpel by it, and the more is our comfort raiſed thereby in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is Chriſt. I do confeſs I am the meaneſt of Chriſt his Servants to attempt ſuch a work as this is; but when I conſider that he that had but his one talent, was accurſed for the Non-improve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of that, and that out of weakneſs God brings the greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:93772:3"/> ſtrength ſometimes, and that out of the mouths of Babes and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, he ſometimes brings out matter of praiſe to Jeſus Chriſt. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe conſiderations I was encouraged to ſend forth theſe Lines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, hoping that God will make them both acceptable and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you, and it may be to other ſouls likewiſe; I know men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parts and gifts have commented on theſe things already, whoſe Volumes are anſwerable to their gifts and parts very large, which every ordinary capacity could not fathom, neither could every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary purſe procure: Therefore did I take the boldneſs, for the profit of ſuch, to appear in Print in this Piece. You muſt not expect it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free of Correction, I hope-both you and any elſe that ſhall meet with it will overlook common Infirmity, and make favourable conſtruction of my honeſt Intention; for the Lord knows my heart, that if I had affected popularity more then ſingleneſs of heart to God and his people, I ſhould not have dared to put Pen to Paper in this work: Therefore for an Apology for thoſe errours and common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, that you or any other may meet with in this Tract, I muſt tell you that I was onely left to my Bible, and my Meditations which I had in Priſon with me, being denied the uſe of any other helps in this buſineſs, as to that outward means, which other men are attended with, you your ſelves do partly know that my Library of Books which I did uſe to conſult with lay for the moſt part in my Pocket, the which I diligently ſearched in Priſon, which made my Task more then ordinary; but I hope I was not left to my own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alone in my labours in the Production of this Book, And I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hope God will not leave you or any elſe that ſhall read this Piece, to your bare reaſon in the reading of it, but will accompany it with his holy Spirit: That you may underſtand it to your great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and comfort, is the deſire of him who ſubſcribes himſelf yours and the Churches faithful Servant while I live in the body,</p>

Lambs, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 2, 3. or young Pigeons, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>Now theſe ſacrifices were all to be put to death, and their blood to be poured out upon the Altar, to make an attonement to God for the people, and they were to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices either without ſpot or blemiſh. Beſides, there was a Goat offered to God which was alive: for the people called the ſcape-goat the manner of offering this Goat to God, you may ſee in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 7, 8. 9, 10. with 21. 22. verſes.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort of ſollid ſacrifices, were of things without life, as meal, or flower: now theſe things were to be bruiſed, or broken.</p>
               <p>Now the liquid kinde of ſacrifices was of oyl, wine, or water; and this was to be poured out upon the ground, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 40. The oyl was oftentimes put to the making of a certain ſort of little thin cakes, which they called wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, appointed likewiſe for ſacrifice, ſometimes of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; ſometimes it was ordered to be put to the ſacrifice for a vow: <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 12. 16. Thoſe were called meat-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and peace-offerings. <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 9, 10, 11. and this the Prieſts were to eat, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 5, 6, 7, 8. beſides thoſe moiſt ſacrifices were to be poured out upon the ground.</p>
               <p>And thus have I finiſhed the order of the Types, I next come to the explanation of them. I ſhall begin with the Paſchal Lamb which the Jews did eat in <hi>Egypt:</hi> firſt I ſhall ſhew you who it did type out, and then make ſome ſpiritual uſe of it to your advantage,</p>

                  <hi>CHAP 1.</hi> Concerning the Lamb which was eaten by the Jews in <hi>Egypt</hi> the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their departure; as alſo the manner how the Lamb was eaten by the Jews.</head>
               <p>THis Lamb typed out Jeſus Chriſt to come, by whom alone ſalvation is to be had; therefore when <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who was a fore-runner of Chriſt, came to reveal and to make him manifeſt to the world, he holds Chriſt forth to the people under the Metaphor of a Lamb, <hi>John 1. 36. Behold the Lamb of God:</hi> to this agreeth the words of <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 7. when he was a preſſing the Corinthians to a diſcharge of duty, in caſting forth the inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from among them, which elſe as leaven, would leaven the whole Church (with guilt at leaſt) he grounds his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation on this point, <hi>For Chriſt our Paſſeover is ſacrificed for us:</hi> where you ſee he gives Chriſt the very name that was given to the Paſchal Lamb. So <hi>Peter</hi> in his Epiſtle, when he is a treating about the price of mans redemption, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 18. 19. verſes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> in the 18. verſe, <hi>We were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with ſilver and gold from our vain converſations, received by traditions from our fathers, but by the pretious blood of Chriſt, as a lamb ſlain without ſpot or blemiſh,</hi> verſe 19. for ſo it was required of the Jews in offering of the paſchal Lamb, that it ſhould be a Lamb without blemiſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 5. So read <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. This title of Lamb is given unto Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev. 6. 15, 16, 17. The rich men and the great men, and the chief Captains, cryed to the hills fall on us, and cover us from the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93772:10"/> preſence of the Lamb for the great d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y of his wrath is come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is the reaſon think you here, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be ſo much dreaded by the great men as well as the poor men at his next coming; for theſe words have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his next coming. I will not here undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether this appearing here of Chriſt be at or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the general Judgement day: as to that I ſhall refer you to abler judgements, who have commented on the thing: but without doubt the reaſon why our Lord is by <hi>John</hi> in that place ſet forth ſo dreadful to men under the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of a Lamb, is becauſe the Lamb was a type of his Prieſtly Office; which includeth the greateſt of grace and offers of love to mankinde that can be.</p>
               <p>Now for the men of the earth, be they rich or poor, yet if they ſhall live or dye, abuſing of, and trampling upon this freely proffered grace, and richly offered love: this turns this grace and rich love, and mercy into the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt of judgements againſt men, Read <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 21, 22, 23, 24, with chap. 12. 42. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee that the Lamb in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. was a type of Chriſt.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. 2.</hi> I now come to ſhew you how the action of the Jews in eating the Lamb, together with the place, time, and manner of eating the Lamb, doth agree to the work of God upon the ſouls of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, while on this ſide Heaven; together with his various dealings with their conditions in this life, which as in a glaſs, thoſe that are ſpiritual may ſee it anſwer face to face.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, the place that the people were in when God provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Lamb for them; It was Egypt, a Land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, abounding with all manner of idolatry and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a Land which knew not God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 2. a land of bondage, of heavy burdens, of cruel task-maſters, that required brick to be made without ſtraw, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 6. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. the officers of which place would often beat the people of the Jews, ver. 14. beſides ſo cruel were the Task-maſters to the poor Iſraelites, that they would not hear the peoples cryes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>To this agreeth, as in the ante-type, the eſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the creature is in before he comes to Jeſus Chriſt, which eſtate or condition we call natural or carnal, which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93772:11"/> ſimbolizeth very well with the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were when they did eat the Lamb.</p>
               <p>For firſt of all, <hi>Egypt</hi> was a place of darkneſs, ſo is the natural condition of mankinde; it is full of darkneſs and ignorance: it is wholly deprived of the ſaving knowledge of God and Chriſt. A man by nature knows little of that bleſſed life, light, power, which the true knowledge of God teacheth a ſoul; he knoweth not what it is to have Chriſt dwelling in him (by his ſpirit) nor what it is for a man to live in Chriſt by believing; much leſs doth he know that great and bleſſed myſtery which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. But we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alas, to tell a carnal man of living by believing, what a myſtery is this to him, of worſhipping God in the Spirit, of praying in the Spirit, of making the Blood, and Fleſh, and Spirit, and promiſes of Chriſt, his daily food; of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hidden Manna, of having the white ſtone, with a new name written in it, that none can read but he that hath it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>Alas, what a paradox is this to a carnal man; to tell ſuch a man of Chriſt within him, and of a ſpiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom within him, and a light within him: and ſo from hence to bid him turn to it, and live obedient thereunto, and to hearken to the teachings of it for ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Alas, one had as good ſtand over the grave of a dead man and bid him ariſe, or one had as good ſpeak to a blinde man and bid him ſee: therefore I think that ſuch a doctrine preached by many in our dayes, is an empty do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to help blinde men to ſee, or dead men to a ſtate of ſpiritual life: therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 2. 14. The carnal man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him (neither can he know them) becauſe they are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcerned:</hi> alſo <hi>Paul</hi> tells you, ſpeaking of a carnal man, <hi>that his underſtanding is darkened, and alienated from the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93772:11"/> life of God, through the ignorance which is in them, through the blindeneſs of their heart, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. therefore when the Scripture ſpeaks of the bringing home of a ſoul to God, it calls it a deliverance from the power of darkneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. a ſtate that affords no light, no knowledge of God in Chriſt, it giveth us no acquaintance with God, as a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled God in Chriſt to a poor ſoul; therefore it may well be compared to <hi>Egypt</hi> for the darkneſs of it: that is the firſt particular.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Egypt</hi> abounded with all manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs and falſe worſhip: for they knew not God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 2. how well doth this agree with the ſtate, or the natural condition of fallen mankinde, O what kennel ſo vile, ſo no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſome, what jakes ſo foul, what Goal ſo loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, what hell ſo black, as the hearts and lives of wicked men: therefore when our Saviour gives a deſcription of the inward parts of ſuch men (ſaith) <hi>That out of their hearts proceedeth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, falſe witneſs, and blaſphemies,</hi> Mat. 15. 19. and to this agreeth the 14. <hi>Pſalm</hi> ver. 2. 3, which ſaith, <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God: they are corrupt, they have done abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble works, there is none that doth good, no not one: the Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand, and ſeek God: they are all gone aſide, they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doth good, no not one:</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>John, 1 John 5. 19. The whole world lieth in wickedneſs.</hi> My brethren, where can you go, into what Land, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, County, City, Town, or Family, but you may bluſh to ſee the common prophaneneſs of it, to your great grief: what ſwearing, lying, couzening, theeving, brawling, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and revelling is there abounding amongſt men: how do the moſt men tumble and wallow in the filth of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: how are ſome buried up head and ears in their pride; how do others glory in their oppreſſion. O how are others drowned in their malice; how like ſwines do others reel up and down in their drunkenneſs; what treachery, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93772:12"/> and falſhood dwells there in the mindes of men, one againſt another, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Micah 7. 4, 5, 6. The beſt of them is as a briar, and the moſt upright of them ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then a thorn-hedge. Truſt ye not in a friend, put ye no confidence in a guide, keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy boſom; for the ſon diſhonoureth the father, the daughter riſeth up againſt the mother in law; a mans enemies are the men of his own houſe.</hi> To this agreeth the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> chap, 2. 2, 3, <hi>Where in times paſt you walked according to the courſe of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience: among whom ye had your converſation in times paſt in the luſts of the fleſh fulfilling the deſire of the minde, and of the fleſh, and were by nature the children of wrath even as others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is that <hi>David</hi> when he was forced to flie into <hi>Gath</hi> among the Philiſtines, becauſe of the prophaneneſs of the people cryed out, <hi>Woe is me that I dwell in Meſech, and am conſtrained to live in the tents of ungodlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As this agreeth with <hi>Egppt</hi> for prophaneneſs, ſo for falſe worſhip: It is natural for men in a carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition to worſhip God in a wrong manner; as a good man ſaid once, every man is born with a little Pope in his belly. To ſet up a falſe worſhip is the firſt thing a carnal man puts himſelf forth in.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon that the greateſt part of the world li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth drowned in falſe worſhip, and ante-chriſtianiſme, it is becauſe they are carnal and blinde, and ſo want the light of God, his holy Spirit to guide them into the truth. Where will you expect to finde fiſh but in the water: where would you ſee birds but in the air; where would you expect to finde four footed beaſts, but upon the earth: ſo where would you finde poor, blinde, carnal men and women wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping, but in their falſe forms, pictures, images, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ceremonies: you may ſee how ſtiff the Phariſees ſtuck unto theſe things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 1, 2. but you may ſee our Saviours anſwer, Ver. 3. with 8, 9. You know <hi>Paul</hi> the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93772:12"/> Apoſtle telleth the Saints in his day, that they had been worſhippers of ſtocks and ſtones, dumb idols: to this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth our Saviours words, <hi>John</hi> 4 22 ſpeaking to the poor carnal woman of <hi>Samaria. You worſhip you know not what.</hi> This is is moſt certain, that the world for want of ſight erre in every thing.</p>
               <p>So that you ſee how well the natural eſtate of mankinde doth agree with the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> for falſe worſhip, or for worſhipping God in a falſe manner.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Egypt</hi> was a place of hard bondage, and cruel burthens, a place that required brick to be made without ſtraw, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. beſides the officers of the place would often beat the people if they failed of ought of their work, ver. 14. they would alſo refuſe to hear the peoples cryes, ver. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>This anſwers unto the covenant of works, which every carnal man and woman in the world is bound unto by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and lives under. This covenant, even to fulfil it in the exacteſt meaſure thereof. This covenant was made with us in the ſtate of innocency, which requires perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in thought, word, and deed, and not onely perfect obedience, but conſtant, continual obedience to the laſt breath, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 5. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>So that if a man fails but in one point of the Law of Works, he is guilty of the breach of the whole, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 10. Now this Covenant of works doth not onely reach the outward actions of the body (as ſome think) but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions, intentions, and purpoſes of the minde; for ſo our Saviour expounds this Covenant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20, 21, 22, with 27, 28. verſes. Now as the caſe ſtands with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with reſpect to his fall, this covenant of works may well be compared unto <hi>Pharaohs</hi> task-maſters, and thoſe that yet live under it, to the Jews in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of thoſe Task-maſters, <hi>Exodus</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12, 13. 14, 15, 16, 17. verſes.</p>
               <p>For firſt of all they required of the Jews, brick to be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93772:13"/> made without ſtraw, ver. 10, 11. ſo doth the Law require full and perfect obedience of the ſoul, both in body and ſpirit as ever it did. Saith the Law, Bring me forth the full tale of obedience, according to my commands: let not ought of the works be deminiſhed which ye ſhould do in ſoul and body; I will not abate one jot of it, bring forth the full tale of your duties, let not one be neglected, if there be you ſhall dye the death; and perform them in ſuch a manner, as I have required, or expect death without mercy: what you do, ſee it be perfectly holy, without the leaſt ſtain of ſin in it, in thy prayings, in thy faſtings, in thy mournings, in thy hearings, in thy almes, in thy works of mercy, in all that thou doeſt; ſee that there be not the leaſt vain thought in it, nor the leaſt ſtain of hypocriſie in it; if there be, thou ſhalt be damned to eternity: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſee that it be conſtantly ſo with thee from thy birth to thy death. If in all thy life thou ſhalt but miſcarry in a word or thought, I will pour out all my plagues and curſes upon thee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 10. I will not regard any thing that thou haſt done in my ſervice before, (though thou haſt ſerved me to the laſt hour of thy life, with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy power;) yet if at laſt thou ſhalt offend in one word or deed thou ſhalt dye the death, a death eternal, of ſoul as well as body, <hi>Ezek. 18. 24. Deut 27. ver.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>Now when the ſoul comes to be awakened to the voice of the Law, how is it overwhelmed with amazement and horrour: like the Jews under their task-maſters, how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly doth the ſoul bewail his condition, crying out with <hi>Paul, Rom. 7. 24. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from ſo cruel a bondage as this:</hi> (Thus the ſoul falling down flat on the ground, cryeth out of his condition, becauſe of the hard uſage it hath from the Law, that it ſhould require the full tale of brick, and yet deny ſtraw.) O ſaith the ſoul, I want ſtrength to perform the leaſt ſervice or duty. O Law, ſaith the ſoul, what no mercy, no pity, conſider my weaknes,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93772:13"/> how unable I am in my ſelf to perform the leaſt duty as I ought. (O Law I pray thee accept of what I can do) no, ſaith the Law, I take no notice of what thou art not able to do, but what thou art bound to do, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no more then is my due; if you cannot give it me, look you unto that, for my part I will have my full tale of perfect and conſtant obedience here in this life; or you ſhall give me ſatisfaction in hell to all eternity. Do not tell me you want ſtrength or ability to perform, go get you that where you can, look you out the ſtraw your ſelves, I ſhall give you none; but let not me miſſe of my tale of brick, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2, 10. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how parallel the language of the old cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant runs with the voice of the Egyptian task-maſters, to the Iſraelites under them. Beſides in <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. we finde th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t <hi>Pharaohs</hi> task-maſters did beat and abuſe the Iſraelites very much in their work.</p>
               <p>This very well ſuits with the old covenant of works: O what laſhes and blows does it give thoſe that live under it. Firſt, In the conſcience within: O what thunder claps have ſome men had within them (from the Law.) O how hath it made ſome men to roar, and to cry out at midnight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their beds, for their breach of it. How dreadfully did it laſh the conſcience of <hi>Cain,</hi> and how did it dog <hi>Judas,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it dogged his neck into a halter: therefore doth the Scripture pitty thoſe that are under it, crying out, a <hi>woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded conſcience who can bear:</hi> thoſe that have been under the laſh of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w in the conſcience can ſay, never was poor man in <hi>Turkey</hi> in the like miſery (they would have exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged conditions with the verieſt ſlave in all the world) night and day terrified with dreadful ſounds of the wrath of God, and the judgement day to come, ſhewing the ſoul his portion in everlaſting burnings, where he ſhall ſeek for death, but death ſhall be far from him. Although the ſoul runneth to his duties, and doth what he can to pacifie the Law; but alas, all to no purpoſe; for the Law quarrels
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93772:14"/> with him about every duty; ſo that here is the Dilemma the Law hath all his in, they ſhall ſuffer one way or other, if they do not live holy and ſtrict in their lives, then he comes upon them with his curſes and plagues: If they do live holy and as unblameable as they can, yet the Law cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them that way, becauſe it is an obedience full of ſpots and defilements, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Law laſheth men externally, as well as internally (in the conſcience.) O what plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments upon body, eſtate, and relations hath it brought home on ſome men for their diſobeying of it: You may ſee a whole file of curſes, plagues, puniſhments, judgments, and afflictious hang up upon the bar of the Law againſt its offenders, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. from ver. 15. to 38.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The officers of <hi>Egypt</hi> would not hear the bitter cryes of the poor Jews under their burthens, ver. 16, 17. how well doth this agree with the old covenant of works, what little mercy doth that ſhew any that are under it, how little is it affected with their cries and tears: could men cry to it for mercy as loud as ever heaven thundered, it would be to no purpoſe, could men weep ſo much blood out of their eyes as there is water in the Sea, the Law would not take any notice of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24. This <hi>Eſau</hi> tried <hi>Heb. 12. 16, 17. For after he had ſold his birth-right he found no repentance, although he ſought it carefully with tears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alas friends, the Law knows no repentance; repentance is a fruit of the new covenant of grace, (not of the old.) Thus you ſee both how the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with its task-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, together with their carriages towards the Iſraelites doth agree, as the type with the ſtate of nature, in which carnel men are in; together with the old covenant, and his carriage toward thoſe that live under him.</p>

               <p>This ſhews the exceeding love and mercy of God to the whole world, who by <hi>Adams</hi> Garden, tranſgreſſion, and their own actual ſins, all are lyable to the deſtroying Angel of Gods Juſtice, which will certainly paſs over the whole earth with a flaming ſword of God, vengeance, to execute it on offenders, Rom. 1. 18. <hi>For the wrath of God is revealed againſt all ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs of men who with-hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Heb. 10. 36. <hi>For if we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a certain fearful looking for of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſary:</hi> ſo <hi>Jude 14. 15. The Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly amongſt them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches which ungodly ſinners
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93772:15"/> have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 7. 8. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels, in flames of fire, rendring vengeance on thoſe that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the whole world lyeth open to the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel of the juſtice of God, which will pour it ſelf forth to the ſcorching of the earthly minded with the moſt dreadfulleſt of fires, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>Now that men might eſcape this dreadful ſtorm which the heavens look black with, over the heads of ſinners, God in mercy hath provided poor ſinners (which are in their Egyptian ſtate of ſin and uncleanneſs) I ſay he in mercy hath provided them a Lamb to eat, which Lamb is his Son Jeſus Chriſt; upon eating of which they really eſcape the hands of the Juſtice of God, <hi>John 3. 16. God ſo loved the world that he gave his onely begoteen Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould have everlaſting life, and not periſh:</hi> which Sonne of God is elſe-where called the Lamb of God, <hi>John</hi> 1. 36. the which, whoſoever takes and receiveth (and eateth in as their food by believing, ſhall live by him) and ſo be free from the deſtroying Angel, <hi>John</hi> 6. 54.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to the manner of eating the Lamb, we may note theſe things; but firſt it was a Lamb without blemiſh: this Lamb relates (as you have heard) to Chriſt, which ſhews the ſpotleſsneſs of his nature, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and pure, free from the leaſt tincture of ſin: for though our Saviour took our nature upon him, that ſo he might become a ſacrifice to God for ſinners, yet he took not our nature upon him as ſinful, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. Therefore doth <hi>Peter</hi> entitle our Saviour a Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. For if he had not been ſo, it had not been poſſible that ever the Law could have been ſatisfied; therefore it is ſaid, that there was no guile found in his mouth.</p>
               <p>But then as to the manner of eating this Lamb. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. Firſt, they were to roaſt the fleſh with fire, ver. 8. This
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93772:15"/> is that dreadful portion which Jeſus Chriſt paſt under for ſinners, in ſtanding under the curſe of the Law; which bitter agony confl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cted ſo in his ſoul, as if all the torments of all the damned in hell had been upon him at once, Luke 22. 24. <hi>And being in an agony, he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</hi> A ſight of which ſufferings of Chriſt <hi>Abraham</hi> had preſented unto him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 9. with 17, 18. verſes: for when God made a Covenant, or rather confirmed the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> God cauſed a burning lamp, and a ſmoaking furnace to paſs between the ſacrifices, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us that none can partake of the Covenant of Grace, but ſuch as have ſatisfied the old Covenant by preſenting it a ſacrifice which will endure the wrath of it: Now none but Chriſt can do this for the ſoul; and this was Chriſt which <hi>Abraham</hi> in this Type ſaw by the eye of Faith, which as a Lamb was roaſted in the ſmoaking furnace and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lamp of Gods wrath for ſinners. Therefore when the ſoul would take in Chriſt, he muſt take him as a Lamb ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with fire, which ſhews the ſufferings of Chriſts ſoul for ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They were to eat all the Lamb, head and legs, with all the other parts belonging to the Lamb; nothing of the Lamb was to be lef to the morrow, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 9, 10, 11. verſes.</p>
               <p>This ſhews us after what manner Chriſt, the Lamb of God, is to be cloſed with by a ſoul that intendeth to have real benefit by Chriſt; not a piece or a part of Chriſt (will ſerve the turn) but a whole Chriſt, or no Chriſt at all: Chriſt is diſtinguiſhed in a three-fold reſpect (as a Prieſt, Prophet, and King) the prophane will accept of one part of Chriſt, the hypocrire of two parts of Chriſt, but none but the gracious ſoul cries for a whole Chriſt. The prophane wicked <hi>Eſau</hi> would cloſe with the Prieſtly office of Chriſt, that ſo the guilt of his ſin might be purged away, and the anger of God for ſin mittigate: but to ſubject to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93772:16"/> office of Chriſt, here he ſticks, he cannot endure Chriſt ſhould reign over his ſoul, he loves his ſins too well then to part with them for Chriſt: ſo that although with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> they that are wicked may ſometime ſeem to cry out under ſin, you muſt know that they are not ſo much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſins nature, as ſins puniſhment: ſo when they ſeem to deſire a Chriſt, it is not for love, but fear; it is not that Chriſt ſhould rule in them, but that he ſhould deliver them from Hell, which they fear they are falling into.</p>
               <p>2. The Hypocrite can go farther then this, he can take Chriſt in two parts of him (both in his Prieſtly and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Office.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In his Prieſtly, that ſinne may be pardoned, he better agreeth with ſinnes nature then ſinnes puniſhment, though he likes it not upon his back, as the prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth; yet he is not much in diſlike with it in his heart: there is ſome ſecret ſin, which is his dellilah in affection, though he ſeem to be an enemy to it in converſation; yet however he could be glad if Chriſt would by his blood get it pardoned, but he loves not that Chriſt as a King, ſhould get it murthered.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He takes Chriſt in the other office as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, if that would do. Now Chriſt as a Prophet, his work is to reveal and make known the deep things of the Father to men. Now ſome hppocrites love to know much, though not to practice any farther then his credit prompts him to it: yet being given to oſtentation, he may covet out after many notions, that ſo he may advance himſelf in the ſpreading of them, as <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8. 18, 19. but no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt can the Hypocrite make choice of.</p>
               <p>But now the ſound Beleiver takes a whole Lamb. O give all Chriſt, and every part of Chriſt, ſaith a poor ſoul which taketh Chriſt aright. O not onely Chriſt to dye for me, but to live in me by his holy Spirit: not onely Chriſt to ſave me, but Chriſt to reign over me, and to rule and govern me by his royal Law in my heart. O a Chriſt to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93772:16"/> get down the power of ſin in me, as well as a Chriſt to raze out the guilt of ſin againſt me. O every part of Chriſt is precious to a ſound Believer, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. So ſaith the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. Chriſt was the chiefeſt to her of ten thouſand, becauſe he was white as well as ruddy. Chriſt was precious for his holineſs, as well as his merits and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>So that this is the thing as to eating the Lamb, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it: the Lamb Chriſt, he muſt be wholly cloſed with, a ſoul muſt take a full of Chriſt, or no Chriſt at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſauce with which they were to eat the Lamb was bitter herbs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8. which ſheweth the frame of Spirit the ſoul is uſually in that truly cloſeth with Jeſus Chriſt: that is, he is under a real repenting frame of heart, becauſe of ſin. O how bitter is the leaſt ſinne to a ſoul which truly receiveth Chriſt: that which was the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ſoul before, is now gall and wormwood to the ſoul: the ſoul looks on his ſins as that which pierced a dear Saviour; therefore it is what pierceth the ſoul, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn over him, and be in bitterneſſe, as one for her firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. Thoſe that think they have eaten the Lamb Chriſt without the bitter herbs of repentance, it is much to be doubted whether they ever eat of Chriſt at all; it is not a bare notional work in the head, but a work attended with a heart broken for ſin, a heart full of godly ſorrow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for its rebellion, and ſtubbornneſs againſt Chriſt. <hi>Peter</hi> wept bitterly for his ſin, <hi>Matth. 26. 75. David</hi> and others have eaten much of this kinde of bitter ſauce with the Lamb: it is the believers continual ſauce all his life long.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The bitter herbs is meant thoſe afflictions and temptations which do accompany the life of a Believer in this life for Chriſt his ſake: our Saviour calls it a taking up the Croſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 23. which is a thing moſt bitter and contrary to fleſh and blood: therefore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> when he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93772:17"/> made choice of this Lamb Chriſt, I conſulted not with fleſh and blood, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. For fleſh and blood cannot endure the bitterneſs of that ſtate in which Chriſt is to be found. Nothing but perſecution, diſgrace, trouble, loſs of good name, yea, and life it ſelf that attendeth the way of Chriſt; therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, 2 Tim. 3. 12 He that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution,</hi> he muſt ſuffer: there is a neceſſity you ſee, that the Lamb muſt be eaten with bitter herbs. Thoſe that will not eat the ſauce ſhall not taſte of the fleſh of this Lamb, <hi>Luke 9. 23. Unleſs a man deny himſelf and take up my croſs and follow me, he ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>not be my diſciple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be a great many would catch at the fleſh of this Lamb Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt, were it not for the bitter ſauce which lyeth in the diſh with Chriſt: many love to ſhear in a Chriſt, but not in the Croſs; thay love the Crown, but not the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which belong to the Crown: therefore ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth to life, and few there be that finde it. Job</hi> found bitterneſs in the diſh where the Lamb lay, <hi>Job 13 26. Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me:</hi> but did <hi>Job</hi> (as many do) leave the meat for the bitter ſauce; no, no, <hi>Job 13. 15. Though thou kill me, yet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll I truſt in thee.</hi> O how happy had ſome been, had they with <hi>Job</hi> ſtill kept to this reſolution; but the wayes of Chriſt were too bitter for them: but I fear thoſe will finde their ſweet meat of this worlds good, attended with the bittereſt herbs at laſt.</p>
               <p>Again, they were to eat the Lamb with unleavened bread, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8. with <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 11. This ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll points at a ſoul eating Chriſt a right, which is the ante-type, which ſhews us thus much.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt muſt be really cloſed with, and not feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly; there muſt not be any thing of the leaven of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie in it, not for any by end, but out of love to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be void of the leaſt love to ſin, if there be any love reſerved to any corruption, Chriſt cannot enter the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93772:17"/> ſoul upon ſuch terms, 1 <hi>Corinthians 5. 8. Let us keep the feaſt, not with the old leaven of malice and wickedneſs, but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity, and truth.</hi> Heb. 12. 15. <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligently, leſt any man fail of the grace of God, leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpring up and trouble you, and thereby many be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,.</hi> Heb. 3. 12. <hi>Take heed brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> if you would as new-born babes receive the ſincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby; you muſt firſt lay aſide all guile, and hypocriſies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, and evil ſpeakings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. 2. That is, all ſin muſt be forſaken, and caſt out of the affection, or no Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the heart: the love of the world, the love of luſt, pride, honour, pleaſure, eaſe, whatever hath been near or dear to the ſoul, he muſt utterly proteſt againſt, or no Chriſt, <hi>Jer. 4. 14. O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved; how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee.</hi> So <hi>Iſa. 1. 16. 18. Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before me, ceaſe to do evil; come now and let us reaſon together,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>though your ſinnes be as ſcarlet, yet</hi> I <hi>will make them as white as ſnow, though they be red as crimſon, yet ſhall they be as white as wool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you ſee there muſt firſt be a putting away the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of ſin, before there can be a eating of the Lamb Chriſt Jeſus: truly therefore ſuch perſons as dream of having Chriſt, and yet retain the old leaven of ſin, are miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Jews were to eat the Lamb with their loins girded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. Girding of the loins ſometimes ſignifieth reſolution to ſome great work, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18. 32, 33, 34. Sometimes it ſignifieth truth and faithfulneſs in the perſon ſo girded, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 6. Here it ſignifieth haſte or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to be gone from the place where they were in before, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
               <p>Now all which ſignifications may be taken into one head and applied to the eating of the Lamb Chriſt Jeſus. For firſt of all, the loins of a ſouls minde muſt be girded as to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93772:18"/> reſolution, that intendeth to eat the Lamb Chriſt. A ſoul muſt reſolve to go thorow thick and thin with him, through a thouſand diſcouragements with Chriſt, ſometimes from within, ſometimes from without; what from inward doubts, and what from outward troubles, a ſoul will find it a hard thing to go on in this way for heaven; thoſe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taunts, ſcoffs, and jeers, that the ſoul paſſeth under for Chriſt, from day to day; ſometimes from its relations, ſometimes from its fellow ſervants who live in houſe with him, and ſo likewiſe from its wicked deriding neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>I ſay theſe things conſidered, the ſoul is many times caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away its hope, and crying out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 73. 13. Verily, I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocency to no purpoſe.</hi> Therefore the loins had need be girded, that ſo the ſoul might not caſt away his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which hath great recompence of reward, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10. 35.</p>
               <p>Now it is the overcoming ſoul ſhall wear the Crown, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 7, 8. Rev.</hi> 2. 10. and the ſoul that endureth to the end the ſame ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 13. Therefore ſaith our Saviour, a ſoul muſt firſt count up the coſt (when he makes out after this Lamb Chriſt, whether he can hold out to the end with him, whether he can run the loſs of fathers love, mothers love, brothers, ſiſters, husband, wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, kinſmen, and neighbours love for this Chriſt; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſoul can part with credit, honour, riches, carnal eaſe for Chriſt, whether he can follow the Lamb whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. For he that looks back is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the kingdom of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 62. So <hi>Heb. 10. 38 If any draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him;</hi> and ſaith <hi>Peter, The laſt eſtate of ſuch men is worſe then the beginning, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>Therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> would exhort againſt faintings and diſcouragements, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e bids men gird up the loins their minde, and be ſober, and hope to the end for the grace
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93772:18"/> that is to be brought unto them at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1, 13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, take girding of the loins as it importeth truth and faithfulneſs: In this ſence the ſoul ought to gird up his loins, if he really intendeth a thorow and full cloſing with Chriſt, he muſt reſolve to be Chriſts in faithfulneſs; as the wife takes her husband, ſhe takes her husband, and onely him, ſhe is not to reſerve any part of the marriage-bed to any other; ſo in faithfulneſs is the ſoul to take Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving that no curſed ſin or luſt ſhall ſhear in the marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of its affection with Jeſus Chriſt: ſo ſaith the ſpouſe ſpeaking of Chriſt her Husband, <hi>My beloved is the chiefeſt to me among ten thouſand,</hi> Cant. 5. 10. <hi>He is mine and I am his, Cant.</hi> 2, 16.</p>
               <p>2. The Wife taketh the Husband to be hers for ever du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life, not to part and fling him off at her pleaſure; therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 2. The woman that hath a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is bound by the Law to her husband as long as he liveth.</p>
               <p>So in like manner is Chriſt to be cloſed with by a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, never to part more, either in this world or that which is to come; to be Chriſts in ſickneſs, as well as in health, in poverty as well as in proſperity, to be Chriſts in bad times as well as in good times, to winter and ſummer with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There be a great many that can put on Chriſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Saintſhip, and can call him Husband in good dayes, but they can as quickly caſt their Chriſt and all away again in bad dayes: when Chriſt ſeemeth to be cloathed with the riches, honours, credit, and gain of this world, then it is he that can court him with ſome ſeeming ſervice; but when he comes to be uncloathed again of thoſe things, and with <hi>Job</hi> to be ſet on a Dunghil of reproach and ſcorn through poverty, then they flye back as faſt again from Chriſt as ever they come to Chriſt; and with <hi>Peter,</hi> curſing and ſwearing, they never knew ſuch a man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 73, 74.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93772:19"/> And like the Jews who could cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Chriſt, when he was ſet by the people upon the Aſs colt; but when in a ſuffering ſtate upon the Croſſe, Crucifie, cruc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fie him; but let ſuch know, this not to eat the Lamb with the loins gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in truth and faithfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Girding of the loins ſignifieth haſte or readineſs to be gone from the place where we were before; therefore it is obſerved that the Jews went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſpeedily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the girding of their loins, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 37.</p>
               <p>This ſhews the ſpeedy motion ſouls are to make from that curſed ſtate of nature, ſin, and ignorance; after their cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, the ſoul is not to ſtay there one night longer; there muſt be not onely a total, but a ſpeedy ſeparation from ſin and nature: the ſoul that truly cloſeth with Chriſt never looketh back again upon his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but he loatheth himſelf for it, he never thinks on it but he hates it, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>What fruit had ye in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed, Rom.</hi> 6. 24. O when the ſoul looks back upon his carnal Egyptian ſtate, and ſeeth what a blinde mad fool he was (together when he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth what ſad ignorant works he alwayes brought forth, when he looketh back upon his drunken, roaring mad, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bouts in the Alehouſe, his running to ſo many Wakes. Revels, Bull-baitings, May-pole Dancings: O how much doth that ſoul which eateth the Lamb indeed mourn for it, O how doth he bluſh before the Lord under the thoughts of it, wondering at the infinite patience of God, that he ſhould be now out of Hell, wondering that God ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſuch a rebellious wretch, ſuch a ſinful ſlave as he ſeeth himſelf now to be) to ſuch a bleſſed Banquet and rich feaſt, as the roaſted Lamb comes to: now on goes the girdle about his loins, and away he goes, flying out of this condition as Hell it ſelf: an inſtance you may take for this purpoſe in <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17. In the Prodigal Son, <hi>And when he came to himſelf he ſaid, How many hired ſervants of my Fathers have bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh for hunger: I will
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93772:19"/> ariſe and go to my Father, and will ſay, I have ſinned againſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired ſervants,</hi> Luke 15. 17, 18, 19. You ſee the Prodigal could no longer ſtay in this condition, when he comes to be ſenſible of the evil of it; but he girdeth up his loins, and puts himſelf into a poſture fit to be gone from all his old delights and ſinful pleaſures, his old filthy companions, he flyes from all, he dares not ſtay an hour longer with them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. 10. ſaith Chriſt in that Pſalm, <hi>Hearken O daughter, and conſider, encline thine ear, forget alſo thy own people, and thy fathers houſe.</hi> Thus you ſee the ſoul is to leave its old carnal eſtate and condition, if he means to eat the Lamb Chriſt Jeſus: Therefore thoſe that are ſo confident they have taken Chriſt, and yet are not come off their old Egyptian carnal condition, truly are much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, ſaith <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 5. 1. If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature; all old things are paſt away, and behold all things are become new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a man to make an account he is in Chriſt and is a good Chriſtian, and yet to live a drunkard, a ſwearer, and a cheater; a hater of Gods people, a deſpiſer of godlineſs, to live in adultery, and uncleanneſs, to live looſe in his family; if this man have cloſed with Chriſt, then ſo hath the Devil alſo, it cannot be; light and darkneſs cannot dwell together, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 15.

               <p>Firſt the ſtaff, Now you know the uſe of a ſtaff in a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers hand is to help him on in his journy, it ſuccours him, it ſtayes up his body from falling, it helps him over diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and dangerous place? This ſtaff leads us to the uſe of the grace of believing, which a ſoul ſhould beg earneſtly for at Gods hands, that ſo after he hath eaten of the Lamb Chriſt, he might be enabled to travel his journey from <hi>Egypt</hi> thorow the wilderneſs of this life; to his Canaan of reſt and glory hereafter: for it is leſs poſſible that a ſoul ſhould travel through the wilderneſs of this world to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hereafter, without the grace of believing, then it was poſſible for the Jews to travel to their temporal <hi>Canaan</hi> without their ſtaff. O how doth Faith ſuccour and relieve the ſoul all along in his way to Heaven; when the ſoul is ready to give over, and is yielding up the ghoſt, how doth this ſtaff of believing raiſe him up again, and putteth a new life of confidence into the ſoul again. Thus it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſet up <hi>David</hi> upon his legs again, <hi>Pſalm 27. 13. I had fainted unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of God in the land of the living,</hi> like a ſtaff under wearineſs it did ſtay up and ſupport <hi>David.</hi> O how did this ſtaff of Faith ſuccour and relieve <hi>Habbakuck, Hab. 3. 17, 18. Although there be no fruit in the vine, and although the fig-tree doth not bloſſom, and there be no herd in the ſtalls, and the flock ſhould be cut off from the fold; yet will I joy in God, and rejoyce in the God of my ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O what a deep ditch did the Pſalmiſt leap over by this ſtaff of believing, <hi>Pſalm 73. 25. My fleſh and my heart faileth me, but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſaith, <hi>The juſt man ſhall live by his faith,</hi> Hab. 2. 4. That is for the ſupport it gives a ſoul in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times; it is this grace that keeps a ſoul above water: this was it which carried <hi>David</hi> through all his trouble, this

               <p>And this was the ſtaff the Apoſtles travelled by all along in their journey (in this life) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 7. <hi>For we walk by faith, not by ſight.</hi> Mark, we walk by faith, It is what the travelling Chriſtian muſt carry in his hand at all times, in the pilgrimage he ſpendeth in this life.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Jews had their ſhooes on their feet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. The ſhooes you know are what greatly helps a man to a comfortable going on in his journey [without which well he cannot travel.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews you what it is to have the feet well ſhod, <hi>Epheſ 6. 15. Having your feet well ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of peace;</hi> that is, a ſoul that takes in the Lamb of God, and thereby hath bound himſelf to flye out of his carnal, prophane, Egyptian ſinful life and converſation, had need firſt of all well furniſh himſelf with the word of God, with the threatning part of it to drive him, and prick him on, with the examples of others lives therein written to draw, him with the promiſes therein to perſwade him, and with the hope of eternal life, true joy, and ſweet felicity, to allure him, or elſe he will finde it a hard matter to come quit of his old condition and carnal converſation.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, Col.</hi> 3. 16. So ſaith <hi>David, Thy word have I hid in my heart, Pſalm</hi> 119. 11.</p>

O hearken to my advice, you muſt be well ſhod with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Goſpel of peace. O ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Search the Scriptures, John</hi> 5. 39.

You know the ſhooes are uſeful to keep the feet from the gauling; truly ſo is the word of God well applyed, very uſeful to keep the conſcience from gaulding and corrupting. for look how it is with a man with ſore feet, he halts and tumbles, not able to keep his ground; ſo it is with a man under a gaulded conſcience, he cannot ſtand ſteddy in any place, but reels from thing to thing, from place to place, and cannot ſtand long any where at a time: now the word of God will help this, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as applyed, or eyed.</p>
               <p>1. As applyed, ſo will it help the gaulded conſcience, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107. 20.</p>
               <p>2. As it is applyed by the ſoul as its rule to walk by, ſo it prevents from corrupting; for as the ſhooes keeps the feet from gauling, ſo will the word of God keep the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from corrupting (if it be carefully obſerved as the ſouls rule to walk by.)</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis in the Ante-type ſhews us thus much by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
               <p>Firſt. That all the particular Churches of God in the world have a like right to Jeſus Chriſt; for though there be one body or Church Univerſal ſpread over the earth, yet this univerſal body is diſtinguiſhed into ſo many little bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or Churches, as Providence thinks good: Hence it is that you have the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking of ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia, Rev.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>Like wiſe we read of a particular Church, which was in <hi>Aquilla</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla's</hi> houſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 15. A ſlender foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for a national Church; and yet all theſe diſtinct ſocieties have all aright alike to Chriſt, as the families of the Jews were all alike to eat the Lamb: therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, There is one body, and one ſpirit, even as ye are called by one hope of your calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme, one God, one Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 4, 5, 6. Through all ages in the world every Church in particular hath had a like benefit by Chriſt (ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93772:22"/> that the weakeſt Church in the world, if it be a true Church, may claim as large a portion in the heart of Chriſt, as the flouriſhing'ſt Church in the primitive times, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were living. You ſee though <hi>Iſrael</hi> were a great body, yet they muſt be divided into ſeveral little Bodies when they come to eat the Lamb, and yet a Lamb for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry family or little body of eaters; ſo that none need to doubt in any age of the world, though the number be great, which have eaten of Chriſt, yet there is enough in Chriſt to ſatisfie all that are to come: therefore is Chriſt called a fountain ſet open for ſinne and for uncleanneſſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 1, 2. In that day there ſhall be a fountain opened to the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. It ſhews the benefit we have by eating the Lamb Chriſt, for we are by it made partaker of families right and order; every ſoul by Chriſt may ſay, (now I am through grace) of the Family of Heaven, and I ſhall have a childes portion with the reſt of the true Iſraelites: though it goes hard with me in this life, though I am poor and low in the world, yet its enough that I am of the houſhold of Faith, my name is liſted in heaven for my daily allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, both for me and mine in this life, and I ſhall have my full portion of glory with the reſt of my Brethren hereafter, [I ſhall have that inheritance that fadeth not away.] O to be an adopted Son of God, what a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is this, O how ſhould this bear up the heart under all diſcouragements, to have a right to all the excellency of glory and glorious attendance, that there is laid up for the heirs of it, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That which eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive the things which God hath prepared for thoſe which love him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much is to be obſerved by the Jews eating the roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Lamb apart (by particular families.)</p>
               <p>One thing more is worth our noting, which is, that the Lamb was to be eaten that night, nothing of the Lamb was to be left until the morning, <hi>Exodus</hi> 12. 10. Which ſhews
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93772:22"/> us thus much, that delayes are dangerous in this caſe, for a ſoul to put off any thing of Chriſt (after he is convinced of the need of him) though it be but for the morrow; the ſoul may never have the proffer more: read that place in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 3. 7, 8. In which place a ſoul is called upon to take Chriſt to day, meaning at the firſt offer, or elſe you may never ſee a Chriſt more in mercy for ever: read <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55. 6. Therefore the exhortation is for men to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and to call upon him while he is near; men will know that God will not alwayes be found, and if any are like to finde it ſo, they are ſuch ſouls as put by Chriſt until to morrow, they have not time to minde the thing; there is yet ſomething of more weight to be minded, ſome worldly intereſt, which muſt be ſet on wards farther firſt, before they can attend this matter. Read the danger of ſetting Chriſt aſide until to morrow, or of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſomething more neceſſary (as ſuch think) before Jeſus Chriſt; read <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16, 17, 18. 19, 20. with 24. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take this along with thee ſoul, remember the Jews were to eat the Lamb at the firſt offer, that which they ſet aſide until the morrow they were not to eat, but to burn with fire, not to eat it again: read <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 10. O Chriſtian have a care thou doeſt not undo thy ſoul this way, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide ſome of Chriſt in a diſh until to morrow, crying out, you are too young yet, or, you would ſport your ſelves a little longer with your corruptions, or your merry companions, I ſay, take heed of that.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 5.</hi> The occaſion of eating the Lamb.</head>
               <p>I Now come to ſpeak ſomething about the occaſion of the Lamb, which was this, becauſe of the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel which was to paſs over <hi>Egypt</hi> on purpoſe to deſtroy their firſt-born; for the ſafety of the Iſraelites, God in mercy to them, ordered them to take a Lamb, and kill him; the blood of which they were to take, and ſtrike the door poſts of their houſes, which was for a ſign to the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, that in his paſſing through the land, where ever he ſhould ſee that blood on the door of the houſe, he might paſs over that without doing the leaſt injury to it; and ſo from thence to the next houſe where the blood was not on the doors; there the Angel was to do his work of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 7. with 12, 13, and 22. verſes.</p>
               <p>This thing ſhews us the great reaſon why God the Father ſent Chriſt into the world, it was that ſinful mankinde might not periſh by the deſtroying Angel of his Juſtice, which will certainly paſs through the Egppt of this world, and eternally ſlay all thoſe that ſhall be found in their ſins Chriſt ſhall come in flames of fire, rendring vengeance on thoſe that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ. 1. 8. 9 Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to prevent this miſchief, and the execution of this plague upon miſerable men and women, the Lord ſent in a Lamb into the world, which was his Son Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo men might be delivered from wrath through him, <hi>John 3. 16. Acts</hi> 4. 12. But this muſt be done, the Blood of this Lamb Chriſt muſt be taken, and by the hyſop of Faith dipped in the Baſon of Goſpel Ordinances, ſtriking
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93772:23"/> the door poſts of the heart therewith: this done, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Angel of Gods Juſtice looking upon it, cometh to be ſatisfied, and hurteth not that ſoul, and becomes that ſouls friend: Therefore ſaith <hi>John, Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſins of the world, John</hi> 1. 29.</p>
               <p>But not a bare looking upon the Lamb will content the Juſtice of God, but the taking of his Blood out of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Goſpel, or dipping therein the hyſop of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and applying of it to the heart and conſcience; ſo to do contents the Juſtice of God: therefore ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1. 7. Meaning the guilt of our ſins.</p>
               <p>To this agreeth the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb 9. 13, 14. For if the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer, ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh, how much more ſhall the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God; purge your conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhewed you the myſtery of <hi>Egppt,</hi> and of the Lamb eaten by the Jews there; likewiſe you have ſeen the manner of eating the Lamb, together with the bread and ſauce with which the Jews were to eat the Lamb: alſo you have ſeen the myſtery of their ſtriking the door poſts of their houſes with the blood of the Lamb; as alſo the myſtery of the deſtroying Angel you have ſeen opened; together with the ſweet harmony it makes to the work of God upon the hearts of his people; which when well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered will make a ſoul cry out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 77. 19, 20. Thy way is in the ſea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy foot-ſteps are not known: thou leadeſt thy people like a flock by the hand of Moſes and Aaron.</hi>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93772:25"/> awakened conſcience, but like ſo many ſwarms of Bees fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round his ears, crying alwayes to him, we are thy works and we will follow thee; we will follow thee in the field, and in thy houſe, we will be with thee at thy table and at thy bed. <hi>Job 20. 23, 24. When he is about to fill his belly God ſhall caſt the fury of his wrath upon him, and ſhall rain it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; while he is eating he ſhall flee from his iron weapon, and the bowe of ſteel ſhall ſtrike him through.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My friends, the guilt of a mans ſin it will go to the grave with him, it will lie down with him in his Sepulchre, and his grave ſhall caſt it up again: therefore ſaith <hi>Job, The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall reveal his ſin, and the earth ſhall riſe up againſt him,</hi> Job 20. 27. Thus you ſee both the diſtreſs, and the cauſe of it upon a poor ſoul under an awakened conſcience, and how it anſwers to the Jews diſtreſs at the red Sea.</p>
               <p>3. We may take notice of the next particular, which is this, That that means which proved a ground of relief to the Jews in their diſtreſs, the peoyle were guided thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by <hi>Moſes:</hi> from whence we may note theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That though man knows how to ſin himſelf into trouble; yet he knows not how to get himſelf out of it. The Jews knew no way out of this trouble, therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to cry out for graves to bury themſelves in the place: ſo is it with the ſoul under the ſence and ſight of ſin, knows no way to eſcape out of that dreadful condition in which he ſeeth himſelf to be, nothing but death on every hand, wrath gone out from above againſt him, hell beneath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its mouth to receive him; and thus the ſoul is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put upon to ſeek out for his grave to bury himſelf in, knows no other way to ſave himſelf, but eternally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf both in ſoul and body like <hi>Judas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Second, If the ſoul have met with any relief in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed condition, let him know it came not from himſelf, but he was guided thereunto by a ſpecial hand of Chriſt: The Jews were led to their means of refreſhment by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:93772:26"/>
               <p>Haſt thou met with comfort and refreſhment from ſuch a Sermon, from ſuch a Miniſter, ſuch a Chriſtian Friend, ſuch a Meeting, or in reading of ſuch and ſuch a Book, conſider, thou wert led unto that means for comfort by the ſpecial hand of Chriſt, and thou ſhouldſt eye his hand in it, that love, and praiſe, and obedience might be rendered him for it; therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>With loving kindeneſs have I drawn thee,</hi> Jer, 31. 3.</p>
               <p>Third, If any ſoul wants relief in ſuch a condition, then let him make unto Jeſus Chriſt for it, for he is thy lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in this caſe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Jews in the other: Read <hi>Deut. 18. 15. A prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you from among your Brethren like unto me, him ſhall you hear.</hi> Now where were the Jews to go in a time of danger bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to <hi>Moſes:</hi> So ſoul, if ever thou wouldſt have eaſe and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou muſt go to Chriſt alone; ſome run to creatures, and think to finde comfort there; others run to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and works of mercy, and thinks to get it from thence: again, there be ſome that will ſend thee to thy inward qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, or work of God within thee, as they call it, or the light within the ſoul. (I am not hereby undervaluing the works of grace, as they are ſigns or evidences of our union with Chriſt,) but I ſend thee to thy true leader Chriſt, who is at the right hand of God, to make daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for ſuch as thou art, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24. O look out and look up to him by faith, for this is the way to it, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 45. 22. and chap. 44. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The next particular is this, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtretched out his hand over the waters and the waters divided, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 21. This act in <hi>Moſes</hi> leads to behold the neceſſarineſs of outward means, contrary to the opinion of many in our dayes; which becauſe we read in the Scriptures of God his teachings within in the heart, and of the holy anointing that ſhall teach them all things; from hence they conclude againſt all outward teaching.</p>
               <p>Queſtion, <hi>What was the reaſon that God had not cauſed the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93772:26"/> waters to go back without the ſtretching out of Moſes hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Not but that God could have done it, but God thereby ſhews us thus much, that it is his pleaſure in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the greateſt ſalvation, and deliverance for his people, ordinarily to bring it about to them by outward means.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour was able to open the blinde mans eyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out clay and ſpittle; a way more likely to put out a mans eyes, then to recover any mans ſight, <hi>John</hi> 9. 6. But it is to ſhew his pleaſure, touching the uſe of outward means: why could not God have thrown down the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> without ſounding of the Rams horn; and why could not God have cauſed water to come out of the Rock without ſtriking of it, but to ſhew it is his pleaſure ordinarily to uſe it in his adminiſtrations to the ſons of men: therefore it is our duty to wait upon God in it.</p>
               <p>Now to the ſtretching out of <hi>Moſes</hi> hand in this outward ſalvation, anſwers the preaching of the Goſpel by God his Miniſters, which is the outward means of the eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for therein is the arme of divine grace and love revealed and ſtretched out to poor ſinners. This <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calleth the revealing of Gods arme, <hi>Iſaiah 53. 1. Lord who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arme of the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed:</hi> So that whatſoever ſome men ſay to the contrary, yet God hath had a ſpecial regard in all ages to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of teaching the word: If God had been mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely to have left men to the inward teachings of his Spirit, why did he take ſo much care to ſupply the ages of the world with Prophets and Apoſtles, was he not as well able to teach the world by thoſe inward teachings onely, as now: why doth the Apoſtle ſay in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. with 12. 13. that he gave both gifts and Apoſtles, Paſtors, and Teachers, for the work of the Miniſtry, until the Saints be perfected, and come unto the meaſure of the fulneſs in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If God were not minded to teach his people that way,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93772:27"/> why did God bid <hi>Philip</hi> joyn himſelf to the Eunuchs Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot to inſtruct him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 29. If God had been minded onely to have left men to the inward teachings, was he not as well able to have taught the Eunuch by his Spirit onely.</p>
               <p>Again, could not God have taught <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. 3, 4, 5, 6. onely by his Spirit, and ſo have ſaved <hi>Peter</hi> a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; yet you ſee God would do nothing until <hi>Peter</hi> was come. I do not plead for outward teaching without the inward, but both muſt go together; ſo that the ſtretching out of God his arme in the Goſpel, may well be compared to the ſtretching out of <hi>Moſes</hi> hand over the red Sea: for as the one was a means to let the Iſraeli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es through the red Sea for a temporal ſalvation; ſo is the other a means to let a ſoul into the red Sea of Chriſts Blood for an eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which leadeth me to the next particular.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The people go through the waters, and are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their enemies, <hi>Exodus</hi> 14 22.</p>
               <p>This leadeth us to the uſefulneſs of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, through which all that are ſaved do p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſs by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: for as the Jews had periſhed without mercy by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Army, had they not paſſed through the Red Sea; ſo will all men unavoidably periſh by the guilt of their ſinnes, without they wade by faith through the red Sea of Chriſt his Blood, 1 <hi>John 1. 7. The blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin. Rom. 5. 7. Being juſtified by his blood we ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from wrath through him. Heb. 9. 12. By his own blood he entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us:</hi> ſo ver. 22. <hi>Without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion. Rev. 1. 5. Who hath loved us, and waſhed us in his own blood from our ſins; for thou waſt ſlain and haſt redeemed us by thy blood unto God, out of every kindred, tongue, nation, and people, Revel.</hi> 5. 9. So that this ſhews us if ever a ſoul would have deliverance from his ſins, which dogs him up and down from place to place, he muſt fetch it in from the blood of Chriſt, held out to his ſoul in the Goſpel. O my friends, you that have the guilt of ſin ſet open to you, would you have it waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93772:27"/> and you that have the anger of God and his wrath flaming hot againſt you, would you have it quenched; O then fly you in all haſte to the bloud of Chriſt, O drink it in by believing, and this will give your hearts eaſe, nothing elſe will do it. O look on Chriſt on the Croſs bleeding for you, get as near the Croſs as you can in your thoughts, and ſtrive to get under his wounds, and open thy mouth wide, and drink thy fill of bloud, adding to it this firm perſwaſion, that the worth and efficacy of this bloud will ſave thee; thou maiſt aſſure thy ſelf that it will, and if ever thou getteſt peace into thy troubled ſoul, it will come and muſt come in this way, for that peace which cometh into the ſoul, which came not in by this way of faith, will in the end prove the greateſt ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 11.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, The ſame waters which proved wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Salvation to the Iſraelites, were waters of Ruine and utter Deſtruction to the Egyptians, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 27, 28. It was a full and total Deliverance to the Jews, and a full and total Deſtruction to the Egyptians.</p>
               <p>This leads us to behold the wonderful benefit that thoſe have by the bloud of Chriſt, that wade through it by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
               <p>A full Redemption from all their ſins at once, the Red Sea took off the whole of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Army at once, not a man left to carry back tidings what became of his fellow; ſo is it a full Redemption that we have by the Red Sea of Chriſts bloud, a Redemption from the guilt of all ſin, there is not one left to carry back news what is become of the reſt; all ſin paſt, preſent, and to come, original ſin, and actual ſin, ſins of all ſorts and ſizes, publick and private ſins, ſins of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Youth, Manhood, and Old Age, ſins committed in all relations, conditions, and capacities whatſoever, yea all ſins with all their circumſtances, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. 7. The bloud of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin, there is not one of them ſhall riſe up to a ſouls Condemnation more, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is therefore now no condemnation to a man in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:93772:28"/>
               <p>Secondly, It is a total ſalvation, it is for ever, the Jews were never troubled with that Army more, therefore ſaid <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſtand ſtill, behold the ſalvation of God: The Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans whom you ſee to day, you ſhall ſee no more for ever, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 13. Such a ſalvation hath the Elect by the Red ſea of Chriſts bloud, it is a Redemption from ſin for ever, not for a year, or two, or ten, but world without end: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith our Saviour, it is eternal life which I give my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they ſhall never periſh, <hi>John 10. 28. Jer. 31. 3. I have</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>loved thee with an everlaſting love,</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi> 13. 1. Where its ſaid of Chriſt having loved his own, <hi>He loveth them to the end.</hi>

               <p>IN which we may take notice of theſe things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Their croſs motion up and down, ſometimes this way, and ſometimes that ways, ſometimes towards their good land, and ſometimes the quite contray way back again.</p>
               <p>Juſt ſo are the dealings of God with and in the ſpirits of the people; that although they are fully juſtified from all their ſins, by paſſing through the Red ſea of Chriſts bloud; yet the after-dealings of God (many times) are very various
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93772:28"/> with his people in point of comfort, what up and down leading (of God) many times do poor ſouls find within themſelves: Sometimes they are well-nigh <hi>Canaan</hi> as they hope within them, and they can rejoyce under the ſhinings of Gods love upon their hearts, and they come to conclude pretty well of their ſpiritual conditions, when they find their deſires to run forth after God, and their affections and love to move out after Jeſus Chriſt; then the ſoul takes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the wings of joy, and begins to mount upwards in the air of comfort.</p>
               <p>But at another time the ſoul is wholly at a loſs, and knows not what to conclude of himſelf, or his condition, he ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confuſion within, all things out of order; the ſoul can feel little affection or love working towards Jeſus Chriſt, little heart to duty, all the ſouls zeal is gone from him, his courage gone, his faith gone, his taſte and ſpiritual ſavour gone, and all ſeems to fail the ſoul, which makes his hope to die within him, and to cry out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 73. 26. My fleſh and my heart faileth me.</hi> Inſomuch that the ſoul cannot believe for one days comfort, and then the ſoul concludes that he goeth quite back again even to the borders of Egypt.</p>
               <p>Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> ſometimes he could ſay the Lord was his ſhepherd he ſhould not want; that he was made to lie down in green paſtures, and led beſides the ſtill waters, <hi>Pſal. 23. 1, 2.

But at another time, far from that condition, but gone quite back again many miles from his <hi>Canaan</hi> reſt, <hi>Pſal. 55 4, 5, 6.

                  <hi>CHAP. 8.</hi> Now the next thing I ſhall ſpeak of in Iſraels condition while in their Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs ſtate, is the Food they there lived upon and were feed with.</head>
               <p>HEre note, that although the place was barren and would not afford any thing, yet they wanted nothing, for God fed them with Angels food from heaven, which food they called Manna, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 14 15. And their water came to them as ſtrangely, for it was what came out of the hard Rock, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Now their Manna was a Type of the woed of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures or writings of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, by which, as with Manna, God feeds his people with all along in their way through their ſpiritual wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their Canaan of eternal reſt and comfort.</p>
               <p>This ſpiritual Manna being opened, preached, and applied rightly, by the Miniſters of Chriſt in the ordinances of the Goſpel, this feeds Believers, and enables them, and ſtrengthens to walk from ſtrength to ſtrength, every one in <hi>Zion</hi> appearing before his God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 84. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>How often do ſound Chriſtians finde this to be true, as that when they have travelled out all their ſtrength by ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving againſt corruption, and wreſtling againſt ſin, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, doubts, and fears.</p>
               <p>How wonderfully have they been ſtrengthned again by the word of God in the ſeveral ordinances of it, as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prayer, receiving of the Supper, and the like. O what
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93772:30"/> renewed ſtrength to duty (and to renew their encounters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin and temptation) have the Saints gotten from the Word, and ordinances of God, what power over corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the world, what freſh ſeals of the love and favour of God have the Saints met with this way, which hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten refreſhed them as with new wine: therefore do the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures call theſe ordinances of the Goſpel (which iſſue forth from the Word of God) a feaſt of marrow, and fat things of wine well refined upon the Lees, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 25. 6. Hence it is, that the word of God is a word in men, <hi>John</hi> 15. 7. and a quickning word, <hi>Heb. 4. 12. Pſal.</hi> 119. 145. and a word of life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 16. and a word of ſtrength, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 81. and a word of comfort, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 82. All this is to ſhew that the word and ordinances of the Goſpel is a Believers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed food, or his Manna to live upon in his journeying through the Wilderneſs of this world, to his eternal Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of reſt and peace: therefore ſaith the Lord in <hi>Micha 2. 7. Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly.</hi> The meaning is, as food doth nouriſh and ſtrengthen the body, ſo doth the word of God the ſoul, it being attended with the Spirit of God.</p>

               <p>Firſt, The Rock out of which the water came.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the water which came out of the Rock.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the Rock we are to underſtand Jeſus Chriſt, for that Rock was a Type of Chriſt; for ſo the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 4. For we all drank of the ſpiritual Rock, which Rock was Chriſt.</hi> Here <hi>Paul</hi> alludes to the Rock in the Wilderneſs, ſhewing Chriſtians in that Type, that Jeſus Chriſt is that Rock, out of which all that refreſhing water of life and comfort which comes home to a poor thirſty ſoul in his painful way to his eternal Canaan of reſt and peace: therefore ſaith <hi>David, When my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the Rock which is higher then I, Pſal.</hi> 61. 2. For as the water which refreſhed the Jews came out of the Clifts of the Rock

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By the water out of the Rock in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, together with the Manna which fell from heaven, may be meant the fleſh and blood of Chriſt which was given for the life of the world, <hi>John</hi> 6. 51. And ſo our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the Type of the Wilderneſs food: read <hi>ver.</hi> 58. with <hi>John</hi> 4. 14 For as a man cannot live where either of theſe be lacking, ſo neither can a man live ſpiritually if either his Manna or water be lacking: therefore it is that Chriſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and in it preſſeth both theſe as neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>John 6. 57. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, that unleſs ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> For by the Fleſh of Chriſt (which anſwereth to the Type of the Manna) was everlaſting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs wrought out for the elect in the room of that which they loſt in their firſt <hi>Adam, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:93772:31"/>
               <p>And the Blood of Chriſt (which anſwereth to the water which came out of the Rock in the Wilderneſs) that was ſhed to take away the guilt of that ſin which the ſoul lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the ſight of the Juſtice of God; this <hi>John</hi> the Divine tells you, 1 <hi>John 2. 1, 2. He is a propitiation in his blood for our ſins:</hi> ſo 1 <hi>John 1, 7. And the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin:</hi> Both of which (<hi>viz</hi> the Manna and water) muſt be applied by the ſoul in a way of ſound believing, or the ſoul cannot live, either the life of grace here, or the life of glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now this is it which is a Believers principle food, which made <hi>David</hi> cry out when he was under the thoughts of it; what an excellent people the Saints were, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. he gives you the reaſon of it in <hi>Pſal. 36. 8, 9. They ſhall be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them to drink of the rivers of thy pleaſures; for with thee is the fountain of life, in thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one thing very remarkable about the Rock in the Wilderneſs, which is this, That the water came not out of the Rock until it was ſtricken by the rod in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which ſhews us thus much, That as all the ſpiritual benefit, light, comfort, and refreſhment (which comes home to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever) comes home to them through this ſpiritual Rock Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: ſo the original cauſe of it was from Gods ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him with the ſtroke of his wrath for ſin, <hi>Iſa. 53. 10 It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief, and to make his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us.</hi>

                  <p>O then what a rate ſhould Believers put upon their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and temporal comforts; were Believers under the real ſence of thoſe dreadful ſtrokes and laſhing blows which our dear Sauiour paſſed under, that the door of grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

                  <hi>CHAP. 9.</hi> I come now to ſpeak of the Iſraelites drinking of the waters of Bitterneſs, called Marah. <hi>Exodus 16. 22, 23.</hi> Though I ſhould (according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) have placed this back before the ſtricking of the Rock; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not omit it, I have placed it here.</head>
               <p>YOu may obſerve, that as ſoon as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were delivered from the Red Sea, and brought into the Wilderneſs, the firſt waters that they drank of (that we read of) were waters of Bitterneſſe, or bitter waters, <hi>Exodus</hi> 16. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>But this was done by the appointment of God: <hi>Moſes</hi> was to take a Tree (which God ſhewed him) Mark that (not every Tree would do it) onely a tree of Gods chuſing; and <hi>Moſes</hi> was to caſt the Tree into the Waters: which done, the waters which were bitter before, became ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the taſte as before, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 5.</p>
               <p>This leads us to the Ante-type, and as in a glaſs it ſhews us theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What portion the ſoul (which hath eaten the Lamb Chriſt) may expect to meet with as ſoon as ever he enters the wilderneſs journey in this world: he muſt preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to drink of the waters of Marah, or bitter waters;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93772:32"/> which waters of Marah they will hold out the ſtate of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which accompany godlineſs in this life: how ſoon do poor ſouls experience (after they have eaten Chriſt the Lamb of God) the drinking of theſe bitter waters of affliction: what oppoſition doth the ſoul preſently meet with, both at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>Firſt, at home, what cruel threatnings doth the wife meet with from the husband; and the husband from the wife; the childe from the parent, and the parent from the childe, and ſo the ſervant from the maſter, the brother from the ſiſter, and the ſiſter from the brother; how reproachfully will they ſpeak of the poor ſoul which hath eaten the Lamb Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, what taunts, jeers, flouts, ſcoffs, and mocks doth the ſoul paſs under (for Chriſt) in the family where he lives, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul with the name of the holy Brother, or holy Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and that they are of the order of the Brother-hood; (though theſe terms are not matter of reproach, but rather of honour, yet the wicked uſe them as words of reproach, to reproach the godly withal) and if the poor ſoul be at his devotion to God at any time, then he muſt be termed a houſe Prieſt, or a Tub Preacher. Thus the ſoul daily drinks of the waters of Marah, or waters of bitterneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123. 4.</p>
               <p>And if the ſoul goes abroad at any time, the ſame he meets with amongſt his Neighbours; its he that can ſport himſelf with the poor ſoul, as the Philiſtines did with <hi>Sampſon, Judges</hi> 16. 25. What miſchief doth the wicked plot againſt ſuch a poor heart as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of, <hi>Pſalm 37. 12. 14. The wicked have drawn out the ſword, and have bent the bow, to caſt down the poor and needy, and to ſlay ſuch as be of upright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, our Saviour tells you what his people muſt expect while in the wilderneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 34. 35, 36. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Think not that I am come to ſend peace on the earth, I am not come to ſend peace on the earth, but a ſword, I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt his father, and the daughter againſt the mother, and the daughter in law againſt the mother in law, and a mans foes ſhall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93772:33"/> be they of his own houſe,</hi> therefore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, He that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus must first ſuffer perſecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, here is not onely perſecution of the tongue which the ſoul doth paſs under for the Lambs ſake; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the hand alſo; impriſonment, loſs of goods, baniſhment, yea, loſs of life it ſelf; therefore ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>You ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake, and they ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my names ſake: yea</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the time ſhall come that he which killeth you ſhall thing he doth God ſervice,</hi> John 16. 2. therefore ſaith <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 1 Pet. 4. 12. Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial, as if ſome ſtrange thing had happened unto you.</hi> No indeed, we ſhould not account it a ſtrange thing to ſuffer for Jeſus Chriſt, and to be brought under trails and temptations for the Lamb Jeſus: it is but a drinking of the waters of Marah which runneth at the mouth or entrance into our wilderneſs condition; which wilderneſs is our way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> through which all our Fathers went, and of which waters all our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have drank of before us: for he that will not drink of the waters of bitterneſs for Chriſt, is never like to drink of the rivers of living pleaſures, which are at the right hand of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal. 16. 11. Matth.</hi> 26. 29.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Moſes</hi> was to take a tree and caſt it into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which done, the waters became very ſweet and pleaſant. This Tree caſt into the waters of Marah types out to us Jeſus Chriſt, who is oftentimes compared to a tree, <hi>Zach. 4 2, 3. Rev. 2. 7. Jer.</hi> 23 5. Its this tree of life caſt into the waters of affliction which makes the Marah waters ſo ſweet to the ſouls of Gods people. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath himſelf dived into the bottoms of this pool of affliction: therefore in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3 he is called a man of ſorrows and acquainted with griefs; and ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that he was in all points tempted as we are, ſin onely excepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. That is to ſay, there is no condition of affliction in which a Chriſtian can be found, but Chriſt the tree of life hath gone before him in the ſame condition of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93772:33"/> to ſweeten and ſanctifie that very condition of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to that ſoul.</p>
               <p>Are you troubled with inward fears, violent aſſaults from the Devil ſo as to be hurried and driven by the violen winds of his temptation,</p>
               <p>Truly in this very condition was Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 5. with 8.</p>
               <p>Is it to be tempted to make uſe of any unlawful means to eſcape the trouble which the ſoul may be in, Chriſt himſelf was in this very condition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4 3. Are the people of God tempted to blaſpheme the name of God, his Word, or Worſhip,</p>
               <p>Chriſt was in this condition before you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4 9. Where he was tempted to fall down before the Devil and adore him as God, what higher blaſphemy can there be then this. Are Gods people tempted to diſtruſt and deſpair of the mercy, goodneſs grace and bounty of God;</p>
               <p>Chriſt was likewiſe in this very condition himſelf before you were, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 3.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, So for outward Afflictions, Chriſt hath gone through them all, and had led the Van of all his travelling Army this way.</p>
               <p>Is it to be derided and ſcorned for fearing God and keeping his Commandments, in this condition was Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13 45, 46, 47.</p>
               <p>Do we looſe a good name amongſt men, ſo did Chriſt, he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93772:34"/> was called a Devil, and Belzebub the Prince of Devils; Is it Poverty, Hunger, Nakedneſs, and Cold, is it to be turned out of doors by friends and acquaintance, is it to be hunted up and down the Country from place to place for our Lives, is it Impriſonment, Condemnation, is it to be made to ſtand to the Bar of Juſtice amongſt the Malefactors, is it death it ſelf?</p>
               <p>In all and every of theſe conditions was Chriſt himſelf, as the Tree caſt into theſe Marah waters of Affliction that he might ſanctifie them to us, and ſweeten them for our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al taſts, reliſh, and comfort.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe 1.</head>
                  <p>Then what need had the ſoul in all his Wilderneſs Trials and Temptations, to fix a believing eye upon Chriſt, and to have great dependency on this Tree of Life, that can take out every Thorne out of his burthen of Afflictions, that only can ſweeten his bitter Cup to him, and can ſanctifie every condition to his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Its reported of the Beaſts in ſome Countries (where the waters are ſubject to more Venome then ours are) that when they come to the water to drink, they all wait for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn, that ſo he might firſt put in his Horn, the vertue of which expels the venemous corruption which was in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before, and then they all drink of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>O ſo ſhould the Lords people wait in the waters of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon Chriſt their ſpiritual Unicorn, who putteth down his long Horn of grace and refreſhment, to ſweeten theſe conditions of Affliction and Trouble to the ſoul, ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12. Chap. ver. 2. 3. Set Chriſt before you as an example of ſuffering, and conſider him who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth ſuch contradictions of ſinners, leaſt you faint and wax weary in your minds.</p>
                  <p>O how ſweet and comfortable to the ſoul (in all his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als) muſt it be when the ſoul conſiders that Jeſus Chriſt went
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93772:34"/> all along in all theſe things before him, to ſanctifie and ſweeten them all to the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, when the ſoul conſiders that Chriſt did not only travel through theſe conditions of Temptation and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſweeten them to the ſouls taſte,</p>
                  <p>But he is the Tree that ſtill lieth in theſe Marah waters as a Companion with the ſoul in all his Trials, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 2.</p>
                  <p>1. Chriſt is there with his power to ſupport them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 10.</p>
                  <p>2. Chriſt is there with his ſpirit to comfort the ſoul while in the affliction, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 4, 5. John</hi> 14. and 16. Chap.</p>
                  <p>To which truth I my ſelf can ſet to my Seal who am at this time a Priſoner for the word of God and the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I can ſay Chriſt is ſuch a Tree in the bitter waters of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, as that he comforts thoſe that are in tribulation for his work and ſervice.</p>

               <p>Likewiſe this Wilderneſs might be called a place of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Miracles, becauſe of the wonderous appearances which God did give out of himſelf in delivering of them from the hands of the enemies, and in bringing of them ſafe to their promiſed land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. where you may ſee at large.</p>
               <p>Now do not our ſpiritual Wilderneſs condition mightily ſimbolize with this deſcription of the Wilderneſs of old.</p>
               <p>O what Rocks of danger do the ſoul ſometimes meet with in his Pilgrimage here in this world, what diſmal providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doth the ſoul paſs under while on this ſide Heaven, what trials and temptations doth God exerciſe his people under ſometime in this world, which like mighty Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſtand up before the ſoul to his great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</p>
               <p>How much poverty doth God exerciſe ſome Godly ſouls under, what ſtraits and hardſhips do ſuch hearts paſs under becauſe of it, ſometimes what ſickneſſes and weakneſſes do others paſs under for many years together; what laſting
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93772:35"/> Impriſonment do others of his people many times paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſome parts of the world. Thus God leads his people up and down amongſt the Rocks and Mountains of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſometime from thence into the Valleys of deſpair and horrour, inſomuch that the ſoul is made to cry out often times, <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth me, Pſal.</hi> 37. 26.</p>
               <p>Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> a man who was led a great part of his pilgrimage over Rocks and Mountains of diſtreſſes, how did God ſuffer the hand of King <hi>Saul</hi> to go out againſt him, how did <hi>Saul</hi> purſue the life of poor <hi>David</hi> from place to place, which made him to cry out, <hi>I am purſued as a Partridge upon the Mountains, and that he ſhould one day periſh by the hand of</hi> Saul, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1.

And at another time his own Child raiſeth up in Arms againſt him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 14. You may take a farther view of the mans condition, <hi>Pſ. 73. 2. As for me my feet had well nigh ſlept, and my ſteps were almoſt gone,</hi> Pſal. 31, 4. with Pſal 30. 3. <hi>Pull my feet out of the not which they have privily laid for me, thou haſt brought my ſoul out of the grave, and thou haſt kept me alive;</hi> ſo Jonah 2. 2, 3, 4. <hi>I ſaid and cryed by reaſon of my affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me out of the belly of hell; for thou haſt caſt me down into the deep, into the midſt of the ſea, and the flouds compaſſed me about, all thy billows and waves paſſed over me, then I ſaid I am caſt out of thy ſight, yet will I look toward thy holy Temple.</hi>

Now there is little of this to be had in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of this world, fix your eyes on what you will here below, here is nothing can afford you the leaſt comfort in ſpiritual trouble, it may be you have riches, honour, many friends, alas, what comfort can theſe yield the ſoul under ſpiritual trouble. This ſerves many times to help on trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon the ſoul, when the ſoul thinks upon the abuſe of the outward comforts which God gave him; but as to the allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of trouble upon the ſoul, they are not to be accounted of; the Wilderneſs of this world is but an empty Well as to that water, which can refreſh the ſoul in a time of ſpiritual trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; therefore ſaith <hi>David</hi> all my Springs are in thee O Lord, and ſaith Chriſt, it is I that can ſend you the Comforter. <hi>John.</hi> 16. 7.</p>

               <p>THis leads us ſtill to behold the condition of the ſoul while on this ſide his Heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> of Reſt and Peace; where do that Chriſtian live, that cannot ſpeak more or leſs of this kind of condition here in this life.</p>
               <p>O the doubts and fears that do ariſe in the heart of a poor ſoul about his eternal condition, when the ſoul is under the withdrawings of theſe ſenſible enjoyments of the love and favour of God to his ſpirit, when the ſoul feels not theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtirrings of the ſpirit of God as formerly the ſoul had

O I ſhall never have his love more, I thought once that I ſhould never have inherited eternal life, O how have my ſoul been comforted heretofore concerning the truth of this: But now all my hope and comfort is gone my grace is gone from within me, my God is gone, my heart and my fleſh faileth me, becauſe the favour of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from me, and I left a miſerable poor wretched ſoul, deſtitute of all help, hope, and comfort; ſo that like as the Iſraelites hearts would fail them for want of bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their Wilderneſſe, ſo doth the poor ſoul in his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Wilderneſs condition, when his bread of life and water of life fails him, when grace ſeems weak, and comforts fail, and the inward ſprings of ſupply grows low, then the ſoul dies (as it were) within himſelf. Thus it was with <hi>David Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>

I called but he gave me no anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look how it was with the Jews in their temporal and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral wilderneſs, no longer then they could ſee their bread and water could they have peace within, but were alwayes complaining, and murmuring, and doubting what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of their conditions, and the condition of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to come: inſomuch that they diſpleaſed God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt them, and made him to ſlay the fatteſt of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 31, 32, For they could not believe for a day, but ſtill doubted of Gods faithfulneſs every moment.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with the ſoul in the ſpiritual wilderneſs, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the ſoul is feeding upon the ſenſible enjoyments of Gods Holy Spirit, the ſoul is ready to conclude deſtruction to its ſelf. Now the duty of the ſoul is to believe, and to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93772:38"/> truſt God, that although we never feel, or taſte, or diſcern any thing within us, yet ſtill to rely upon this promiſe, that God will ever be mindeful of his Covenant: ſo did <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
               <p>O what a bleſſed frame of ſpirit was the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> in, <hi>c.</hi> 3. 17. 18, 19. When he uttered theſe words, <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhould not bloſſom, neither ſhould fruit be in the vine, the labour of the olive ſhould ceaſe, and the field ſhould yield no meat, and the flock ſhould be cut off from the fold, and there ſhould be no herd in the ſtall, yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of my ſalvation: the Lord is my ſtrength, he will make my feet like hindes feet, and he will make me to walk upon high places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly my friends, the beſt life is a life of believing, O this brings you in the moſt ſolid comfort and peace: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Habakkuck,</hi> cap. 2 4. The juſt man ſhall live by his faith, and ſaith the Apoſtle, We walk by faith and not by ſight, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p>O ſouls, my exhortation to you is what was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to the <hi>Hebrewes, Heb. 3. 12. Take heed of ſuffering in you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O labour to live more and more by believing, and leſſe by ſenſe becauſe its a life that beſt ſuits the ſtate you are in, remember you are in the Wilderneſs, a place which affords great grounds of fears and many doubtings, and therefore you had need of a great deal of faith in the promiſes of God and the faithfulneſſe of God, or you may faint by the way, and at laſt die in the Wilderneſſe, and ſo never ſee the good land, <hi>Heb. 4. 1. Let us therefore fear leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of us ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what is it that ſo much endangers a ſouls falling ſhort of the good land, the <hi>Canaan</hi> of reſt, (look you into the 3. chap. of this Epiſtle and the 18. ver.) You ſhall ſee it was want of a believing ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Again, the Iſraelites fears did ariſe from thoſe enemies which aſſaulted them in the Wilderneſſe, as <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan</hi> and the <hi>Amal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:93772:38"/>
               <p>Thus it is with the ſoul in his ſpiritual Wilderneſſe, O what out-cries doth the ſoul oftentimes make, with reſpect to theſe horrid aſſaults, the ſouls enemies oftentimes makes againſt him in his inward man.</p>
               <p>How doth ſin, and luſt, and temptation aſſault the poor ſoul; with what violence and ſtrength doth worldly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe break in upon the ſoul; what ſad aſſaults doth Pride, Revenge, Concupiſcence, and Unbelief oftentimes viſit the ſoul withall, which makes the ſoul cry out (with <hi>David</hi>) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hands of theſe Sauls which purſue my ſoul night and day like a Partridge upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;</hi> I ſay, what ſad fears do the riſings of theſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons oftentimes occaſion in the ſouls of Gods people, which makes the ſoul to queſtion his condition many times ſaying, ſurely if I did belong to God, why is it thus with me; O if I had true grace, my corruptions could never be ſo ſtrong in me as they are.</p>
               <p>O ſoul remember thou art in thy Wilderneſſe condition, and that affords great enemies, and tall <hi>Anakins,</hi> and curſing <hi>Balaams,</hi> which will very often afright thee with their raging blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>How often doth the ſoul find within him (not only an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, warring, fighting <hi>Og</hi> within him) but alſo a curſing, dreadful, blaſphemous <hi>Balaam,</hi> as it were daily curſing the holy ſeed of God within the ſoul, which often times makes the ſoul to deſpair of ever getting home to his <hi>

                     </gap>anaan</hi> of reſt and peace. Thus it was with <hi>David, Pſal. 39. 4. All my iniquities are gone over my head as an heavy burthen, they are too heavy for me,</hi> Pſal. 65 3. <hi>Iniquities prevail againſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it was with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> how ſenſible was he of the wilderneſſe-aſſaulting <hi>Og,</hi> and the <hi>Amalekites</hi> like corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which very often roſe up againſt him in his travelling through his ſpiritual wilderneſſe, which made him to cry out in <hi>Rom. 7. 24. O wretchedman that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death.</hi> Which leads me to the next parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of the ſouls condition while on this ſide his <hi>Canaan</hi> of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93772:39"/> everlaſting reſt and true peace: which is this. The Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of old was a place of diſcouragements; for there the falſe ſpies brought up that diſcouraging report about the good Land, and ſo weakened the hope and confidence of the people, which put them upon chuſing a captain to go back again to <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How much of this kinde of experience do poor ſouls meet in their way to their ſpiritual and eternal Canaan; what ſad diſcouraging reports doth the Devil and his agents bring up upon the good Land of Canaan to this very day and hour.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Devil, how often doth he tell the ſoul, that he were as good go back again from the good wayes of God as to go on any further in them: for all the ſouls duties ſhall be as rewardleſs as they are worthleſs, and that God taketh no notice of him: and as for his ſins they are too great for God to pardon them; and therefore let the ſoul never think (ſaith Satan) to get out of my kingdom and power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for doeſt thou believe (ſaith the Devil) that if God could pardon thy ſinnes, that ever he would look on ſuch a worthleſs, vile, ſinful, poluted wretch as thou art, who doeſt all things in hopocriſie of heart: no, no, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy ſelf, thou ſhalt finde it otherwiſe; and therefore thou wert as good go back again to thy old converſation, and live as thou didſt before.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſaith Satan, doeſt thou ever think to enter ſo ſtrait a gate as leadeth to heaven; doeſt thou not know that the Anakims both great and tall are in the way; doeſt thou not know that if thou goeſt this way any farther thou wilt loſe the favour of all thy friends and relations; doeſt not thou ſee what a gazing ſtock thou wilt make thy ſelf to all thy neighbours and acquaintance round about thee; doſt not thou ſee the taunts, flouts, ſcoffs, and jeers which they will fling daily after thee: beſides, thou art now pretty well to live in the world, and haſt things full and whole about thee: but by thoſe fines and ſequeſtrations which the world
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93772:39"/> will lay upon thee, this will quickly be gone from thee, and thou and thine forced to periſh in a miſerable condition. Moreover, doeſt thou not ſee before thine eyes, how ſome are whipt, others impriſoned, and at laſt hanged up by the neck: aſſure thy ſelf this will be thy portion if thou goeſt any farther this way. Come, come, ſayes the Devil, I will ſhew you a better way, be adviſed by me, come turn back again, ſave your ſelf, and what you have; you do but dream of building Tabernacles in the air, aſſure your ſelf by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way you are a going you do but wade through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities, and all ſhall fail you in the end: therefore get thee back again to the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the old carnal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from whence thou haſt been travelling a while, and fed upon onyons, leeks, the garlick and cucumbers which thou haſt been a planting for many years, and eat the fat of thy fleſh pots, and take thy pleaſure here; for there is nothing better under the Sun, then that a man ſhould rejoyce in his own works; for that is his portion: for who ſhall bring him to ſee what ſhall be after him.</p>
               <p>Thus the poor ſoul hangs in doubt, and is oftentimes put to a ſtand, not knowing what to do, nor which hand to take; whether it be beſt to go back or forth in the wayes of God, becauſe of his diſcouragements.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Satan will not leave the ſoul thus, but labours to ſet before the eyes of the ſoul the apoſtaſie of back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding profeſſours, who have both their principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes in the wayes of God; from whoſe converſation he labours to argue the ſoul into the ſame practice of leaving the good wayes of God, and tells the ſoul, that in ſo doing, or in going back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> he doth no more then others have done before his face; perſons of greater parts and gifts then ever he yet had: and ſurely ſuch knew well enough what they did, and in doing what they have done, they have te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified themſelves to be perſons that were acted by a wiſe prudent ſpirit; ſuch who make proviſion for their families according to Gods holy ordinance.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:93772:40"/>
               <p>Thirdly, If Satan the old Serpent cannot prevail with theſe ſecret whiſperings upon the ſoul, then he will ſend in his agents to deal farther with the ſoul; as Father, Mother, Husband, Wife, Children, and ſervants too; which cry out as <hi>Peter</hi> did once to Chriſt, <hi>Good maſter ſave your ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if all theſe cannot diſcourage the ſoul, then will Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan adde to all the reſt one or two apoſtatizing profeſſours, who with the reſt, hang all together about the ſoul, crying out, Sir, what mean you to do, what have you a minde to ruine your ſelf and all your family; do not you ſee that the Law of the Nation will not endure your Religion, nor thoſe wayes of Worſhip which you ſet up and walk in.</p>
               <p>Have not you had warning enough in others (who have loſt all they had, and themſelves in priſon) to deſiſt your work, and retreat your ground and come back again.</p>
               <p>Then in comes the prudent apoſtate (not that he is ſuch) but he, and ſuch as he is thinks themſelves ſo; and he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to give the ſoul arguments from Scripture, to ſave himſelf, his Wife, and Children, and all his family, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that he ought to be ſubject to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake; and that if he be commanded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do, or not to do, which conſcience at any time can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not let down, yet however he may ſatisfie himſelf with this conſideration; that its the Magiſtrates ſin in commanding the thing, or forbidding the thing to be done by in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God (if the thing commanded or forbidden be in its ſelf an evil) but not the ſubjects in obeying the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or forbidden.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how difficult the Devil labours to render the poor ſouls way to the good Land, and how Satan fills the ſouls paths with diſcouragements; and how much Satan is like to prevail, without the infinite power of God be put forth to help and bear up the poor ſoul in his way to the good Land, which leads me to the next particular, which is this.</p>
               <p>The wilderneſs of old might well be called the place of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93772:40"/> wonders, becauſe of the great miracles which the Lord did work for the Jews in their travels, in that notwithſtanding all the ſeeming deaths &amp; dangers the people paſt under in the Wilderneſs; yet the Lord by a powerful hand brought them to their promiſed Land in ſafety.</p>
               <p>So ſoul, take this for thy comfort, that whatever the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be that thou meeteſt with in the way to thy eternal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, yet bear up, fear not, for God will at laſt deliver thee out of the hands of all thy enemies, and carry thee ſafely through to thy appointed reſt of glory, that thou mayeſt ſerve him in righteouſneſs and true holineſs in bliſs to all eternity, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74, 75.</p>
               <p>O ſoul, therefore hold up thy head, the work is the Lords, and although he ſuffers thee to tug with fearful difficulties and great oppoſitions; yet know this, that the battle is the Lords, and he will fight it in thee for thee: its true, it may be (as with <hi>Gideon</hi>) thou art ready to cry out of thy own weakneſ, thy family is the ſmalleſt in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thou the leaſt in the family; but let me ſpeak to thee in the words of the Angel to <hi>Gideon, Judges 6 12. Up, for God is with thee thou mighty man of valour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O ſoul, the Lord is engaged to bring thee home to glory, God hath ſworn by his holineſs, that it ſhall be ſo: therefore it muſt be ſo, read <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89. 33. 34, 35, 36, 37.</p>

               <p>You may call the breathings of the Spirit of God in the hearts of the godly, the fore-running bunch of Grapes of the eternal Canaan, which doth yield forth his bleſſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, comforting, chearing juyce into the hearts of the people of God.</p>
               <p>God gives out the holy Spirit to aſſure the godly that the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93772:43"/> Land is a good Land unto which they are a travelling. God gives his people the ſweet ſenſible taſtes of glory to come before-hand.</p>
               <p>O how hath God drenched the ſouls of his people with draughts of this ſalvation ſometimes, when in an ordinance of God. This made <hi>David</hi> prize ſo much the houſe of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27 4. It was the coming down of thoſe heavenly Grapes, or ſpiritual Dews from the Spirit of God, which did ſo much draw and atttact his heart thither-ward ſo much, <hi>Pſalm 36 8.

Yet how hard a matter doth the ſoul finde it to bear up with God in a way of believing: how doth the Devil labour daily to make
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93772:43"/> the ſoul to call in queſtion his greateſt enjoyments of the Spirit of God: thus it was with the good man in the Pſalms, <hi>Pſalm 73. 25.

                  <hi>CHAP. 14.</hi> I come now to ſpeak of thoſe Types which were handed out to the Jews in the time of their being in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</head>
               <p>THe firſt was the cloud, which alwayes led them up and down in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 3, 4. with 36, 37, 38. verſes. Now this Cloud was undoubtedly a Type of Jeſus Chriſt, in theſe two reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that the cloud guided the people from place to place, up and down in the Wilderneſs; ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he it is that leadeth the Church up and down in the preſent Wilderneſs of this World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 2. And as the Jews were not to move any way until the Cloud went before them; ſo it ſhould teach all Chriſtians not to move any way (in what condition ſoever they be in) until they can ſay, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt their ſpiritual Cloud goes before them, and leads their way for them: that ſoul loſeth the honey of the condition he is in, that wanted patience to tarry for Chriſts leadings, as in the caſe of King <hi>Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 13. 9, 10, 11. Therefore the advice and councel of the Lord to all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is this, <hi>Iſa. 52. 12. For ye ſhall not go out with haſte, nor go by flight, for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Iſra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l will be your reward:</hi> ſo <hi>Iſa 28. 16. And he that believeth ſhall not make haſte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Cloud was a Figure or Type of Chriſt, for its protecting and ſheltering uſe which it afforded the Church in the Wilderneſs of old, by which means they were hid from danger: ſo is Jeſus Chriſt ſuch a cloud of protection
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93772:44"/> to his Church and people in their wilderneſs condition in this life, as that though Satan, the world, and the fleſh, ſet upon the Church with a purpoſe to overthrow and devour them at once, yet they cannot overcome them. Hence it is that <hi>David</hi> calls Chriſt a defence, and a refuge to his people: ſaith <hi>David, Pſalm 58. 16. I will ſing of thy power, yea I will ſing aloud of thy mercy in the morning, for thou haſt been my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and refuge in time of trouble:</hi> ſo <hi>Pſalm 94. 22. But the Lord is my defence, my God is the rock of my refuge:</hi> ſo ſaith the Church in <hi>Iſa. 12. 2 Behold, God is my ſalvation, I will trust and not be afraid, for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my ſong, he is alſo become my ſalvation:</hi> Therefore doth <hi>Paul</hi> make it to appear, that the Cloud in the Wilderneſs was a Type of Chriſts great care of, and protection over his Church, <hi>1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4. For we were all Baptized unto Moſes in the cloud, and in the Sea, and did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did all drink of the ſame ſpiritual rock that followed them, which Rock was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hriiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee not I onely, but the Apoſtle alſo applies the Wilderneſs Cloud to Jeſus Chriſt, which muſt hold out, and intend the great ſafety which Chriſt doth daily adminiſter to his Church, as the Saviour of it.</p>

                  <p>Then this ſhould teach thee ſoul, when ever thou art aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by temptation ariſing either from the Devil, the World, or thine own corrupt heart, then to get in under this Could, and there to ſhelter thy ſelf; here wilt thou be covered in the day of battle, and thou needeſt not fear what men or Devils can do againſt thee, <hi>Pſalm 26. 3. 5. Though an hoſt ſhould encamp againſt me my heart ſhall not fear though war ſhould ariſe againſt me, yet in this will be confident, for in the time of trouble he ſhall hide me in his pavilion, in the ſecret of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle ſhall he hide me, he ſhall ſet me upon a rock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how confident <hi>David</hi> was, and thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93772:45"/> to be under this covering and cloud of defence. O ſoul, ſo will it be with thee if thou flieſt to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and art careful to make him thy covering and protecting hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cloud: thou ſhalt then be far from trouble, no evil ſhall come nigh thy tabernacles. <hi>Job 11. 17. 18, 19. Thine age ſhall be clearer then the noon day, thou ſhalt ſhine forth, thou ſhalt be as the morning, thou ſhalt be ſecure, becauſe there is hope; yea, thou ſhalt dig about thee, and thou ſhalt take thy reſt in ſafety; alſo thou ſhalt lie down, and none ſhall make thee afraid, yea many ſhall make ſuit unto thee.</hi> But if on the other hand thou ſhalt neglect to get under the ſpiritual cloud and covering; what ever covering elſe thou ſhalt hide thy ſelf under, it will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail thee in the time of trouble, for God will tear it to pieces, and thou wilt be found naked; then woe, woe to thee in the day of Gods wrath, when he ſhall come forth to render vengeance upon all that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7. 8, 9.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe occaſion of which was this: becauſe of thoſe hot fiery ſtinging Serpents, which in the Wilderneſſe had deſtroyed ſo many of the Iſraelites up and down in the Countrey; therefore did the Lord out of compaſſion to the Jews cauſe a thing to be made called a Serpent; and it was to be ſet upon a pole for this end (<hi>viz.</hi>) that if at any time any of the people ſhould be ſtung by any of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents in the Wilderneſs; if they at the ſame time ſhould but look up at the Brazen Serpent ſet upon a pole in the midſt of the Camp for that purpoſe, this would bring them home an immediate cure upon their perſons at the ſame inſtant.</p>
               <p>Now this Type had (as to its uſe) ſpecial reference to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; for ſuch a remedy is Jeſus Chriſt to ſpiritual ſtinged ſouls. God in mercy to the elect hath ſent his Son into the world, and advanced Chriſt his Son upon the pole of the Goſpel, that he might cure them of their ſpiritual ſtingings (occaſioned by Sinne, and the Devil, the worſt of Serpents.)

                  <p>O ſoul, if thou wilt but look up to Jeſus Chriſt the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Serpent by an eye of faith, thou mayeſt as certainly expect a cure to be wrought on thy ſoul, as the Iſraelites who in looking up to their brazen Serpent in the Wilderneſs might expect a cure to be done on their bodies: therefore is ſalvation tendred upon this act of the ſoul in looking up to Chriſt by an eye of faith, <hi>Iſa. 45 22.

                  <hi>CHAP. 16</hi> I now come to ſpeak of the Tabernacle, another Type given out to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites in the VVilderneſs, the manner and form of it <hi>I</hi> have already deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to you before.</head>
               <p>THis Tabernacle was typical two wayes, or it typed out theſe two things to us.</p>
               <p>Firſt. Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It typed out Chriſt himſelf, and that in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As to the glory and excellency of Jeſus Chriſt, the Tabernacle was exceeding excellent and glorious within, for all the inward parts of it were over laid with pure Gold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. This was to ſhew us the richneſs and worth of the Son of God, that ſo the creature might ſee cauſe to deſire him, love him, and chuſe him to themſelves, as their higheſt portion for ever: therefore when the Holy Spirir doth ſpeak of Chriſt, it ſpeaks of him under this conſideration as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, <hi>Prov. 3. 13, 14, 15, 16. Happy is the man that findeth wiſdom, and the man that getteth underſtanding, for the merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of it is better then the merchandize of ſilver, and the gain thereof then fine gold; ſhe is more precious then rubies, and all the things which thou cauſt deſire are not to be compared to her; length of dayes are in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Heb.</hi> 13. (ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith) <hi>He is the brightneſs of his Fathers glory, and the expreſs image of his Fathers perſon.</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:93772:47"/> Therefore ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>He is the chiefest to me of ten thouſand.</hi> And to this agreeth the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 7. To you which believe he is excellent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As the Tabernacle typed forth Chriſt in point of beauty or excellency, ſo in point of acceptation; for in the Wilderneſs, if the people would worſhip God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, it muſt be at the door of the Tabernacle: ſee <hi>Numb. 8. 15. chap. 18. 3, 4. 7, 8.</hi> and at the Tabernacle door were the people to wait, until the Prieſt within had done the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Tabernacle for them before the Lord: which ſhews us thus much, that if we intend in Goſpel dayes to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Father acceptably, we muſt come to the Father, at the Tabernacle Chriſt, and by the hand of Faith lay down our offerings at the door of his Worth and Merits: therefore ſaith Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John 14. 6. I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man can come to the Father but by me.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe 1.</head>
                  <p>O therefore ſoul, when ever thou doeſt any thing of the Worſhip of God, be ſure thou come to God alwayes by the door of this Tabernacle Chriſt, if thou meaneſt to be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted in and about what thou doeſt in the ſervice of God, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all thou haſt to offer God withal, in Chriſts name, in and by his worth and merits, onely for his ſake, and upon his account, and be wholly nothing in thy own eſteem: Come to the door of the Tabernacle, under the ſence of a meer piece of nothing; bring with thee a ſelf-loathing, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemning, ſelf-abhorring frame of ſpirit, and let Chriſt be all, and in all to thy ſoul, and in thy eſteem, when thou art before the Lord in point of acceptation, <hi>Phil. 2. 8, 9. I count all things but as dung in compariſon of Christ, and I deſire to be found alone in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Tabernacle was a Type of Chriſt in point of revelation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 35. with <hi>Levit. 1. 11. Exod.</hi> 30, 6. For
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93772:47"/> thorow it God appeared to the people, and out of which God gave the knowledge of his will and minde, as the above Scriptures ſhew.</p>
                  <p>This anſwereth to the uſefulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to the Elect of God, or it ſhews us very much of the prophetical Office of Chriſt; for it is Chriſt onely that can give out the knowledge of his Fathers will and pleaſure to the Church of God. All the manifeſtations of the love, grace, mercy, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and councel of God comes home to the Church, through the humane nature of this bleſſed Tabernacle Chriſt Jeſus: therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John 14 24.

                  <p>O therefore ſoul, if thou wouldſt have more fatherly grace let out upon thy ſoul, if thou wouldſt have more of the knowledge of God, more of the love of his Spirit of Light and aſſurance, if thou wouldeſt know more of his will ſo as to obey it and live to it, O then wait upon God at the door of this Tabernacle Chriſt, for in him it is that the Father will ſpeak with thee, and no where elſe, <hi>Matth. 3. 17.

                  <hi>CHAP. 17.</hi> I now come to ſpeak of the ſeveral things in the Tabernacle, and firſt <hi>I</hi> begin with the Ark.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, there was in the Tabernacle a very glorious thing called an Ark, <hi>Exod. 37. 1, 2.</hi> The ſignification of which we finde to be the Worſhip of God accompanied with his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93772:48"/> preſence; therefore in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 21. when the Ark was taken by the Philiſtines, its ſaid that the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For indeed the worſhip of God is the glory of any Nation, and when that is gone their true glory is gone, although it may be they do not ſee it.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe 1.</head>
                  <p>Then how may we pitty thoſe Nations that are without the true worſhip of God, alas they are without true glory, they have not excellency or beauty upon them, they have not the worſhip of God; whatever they may account of themſelvs, yet God and his word accounts them to be a baſe ignoble nation or people, a whole nation of them not worth one ſingle perſon of that people which have the worſhip of God amongſt them: read <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where God is a ſpeaking of theſe perſons that had his worſhip kept up amongſt them, and do but obſerve how God values them in compariſon of others which had not this true worſhip amongſt them, ſpeaking to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Iſa. 43. 3, 4. For I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of Iſrael thy Saviour; I gave Egypt for thy ranſome, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia and Seba for thee: ſince thou haſt been precious in my ſight thou haſt been honourable, and I have loved thee:</hi> I <hi>will give men for thee, and people for thy life.</hi> Now <hi>Iſrael</hi> had the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God amongſt them, but <hi>Ethiopia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seba,</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> had not: and that is the reaſon that God prefers <hi>Iſrael</hi> above and beyond the other nations: but when the God of this world hath wholly blinded the eyes of the nations of the earth, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. As that the light of the glorious Goſpel cannot ſhine in upon their hearts: Its no wonder if the nations of the earth findes not the want of this mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, O then what a ſad thing is it for a Nation that once had the Goſpel amongſt them ſhining in its luſtre and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93772:49"/> brightneſſe round about their Tents and Tabernacles to be guilty of driving and forcing the Goſpel away, and the pure Worſhip of God away from them; what worthleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſuch, and what a worthleſs Nation is ſuch a Nation (think you) in Gods ſight, who ſhall in the face of God cry down, and vote down, and thruſt out from amongſt them the Ark of his Worſhip and Goſpel, as a thing not worthy to live or abide amongſt them. Certainly if the <hi>Gadarens, Luke</hi> 8. 37. Did render themſelves a vile people in Gods ſight in putting Chriſt from their Country (though done with a mild intreaty) how much more vile hath that Nation or people rendred themſelves in the ſight of God, who have not pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the <hi>Gadarens</hi> to intereat him civilly to depart from them, but wicked <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like, doth violently force him and drive him out of their Coaſts; Certainly I know not a blacker Character can hang over a people or Nation, then this Character which do more ſtrongly witneſſe the Ruine of ſuch a people then this doth, read theſe places, <hi>Prov. 1. 25, 26, 27. 2 Chron. 36. 16, 17. Theſ. 1 2, 15, 16.</hi> You likewiſe know what became of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his whole Army, together with all the glory of his Kingdom, ſuddenly after he had contracted this kind of guilt upon him and his Nation; and certainly the Lord favours this kind of ſin no more now then in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> time, and his arm is not ſhortned, he is as well able to reach ſuch a Nation now as then: O where this kind of ſin dwells, the good Lord give that Nation ſound Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for it before he comes to tear them in pieces.</p>
                  <p>A 2d thing about the Ark which we are to take notice of is this, you read in <hi>Exod.</hi> 37. 2. That the Ark was overlaid with pure gold; which ſheweth us both the excellency and purity of the Worſhip of God, for as gold is both excellent and pure, ſo is the Worſhip of God, it is both excellent and pure; therefore when that holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of the Worſhip of God, he compares it to a Sea of Glaſs as clear as Cryſtal, <hi>Revelations</hi> 4. 6. Meaning for the worth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it.</p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:93772:49"/>
                  <p>A third thing about the Ark is this, there was a Crown of gold round about above upon it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37. 1, 2. This Crown upon the Ark denotes the Authority which God hath ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Worſhip, Gods Worſhip hath his Authority ſet upon it, for ſuch is the Import or ſignification of the word Crown, or the thing called Crown, it ſignifies Rule and chief Authority, which commands obedience and ſubjection to its Law, Will, and pleaſure.</p>

                  <p>The uſe we ſhould make of this Myſtery will teach us this Leſſon. Firſt, to their peril who ever they be that ſhall dare to alter any part or Tittle of this Worſhip of the Altar, or ſhall mix it with any of their own whoriſh, helliſh Inventions, or Romiſh fopperies, <hi>Deut. 12. 32. What thing ſoever I command you, that obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not add thereunto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is that <hi>Moſes</hi> in the giving out of the Worſhip of God to the people was admoniſhed, that he ſhould not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the pattern ſhewed him in the mount, we are to take notice of the pattern laid down in the word of God, and by that Rule to build Gods houſe, and only according to that to ſteer our compaſſe in and about the Worſhip of God, <hi>Iſa. 8. 20. To the Law and the Teſtimony, if any man ſpeak not according to this Rule, its becauſe there is no light in him:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Crown upon the Altar ſhews us thus much, that none are left to their wills as arbitrary in the performing of Worſhip to God, ſo as to do it when we pleaſe, as none are left (in this caſe) ſo to their own wills to do it how they pleaſed; ſo likewiſe none are ſo left to their wills to do it or perform it when or at what time they pleaſe, neglects in this caſe are dangerous, not to attend the Worſhip of God either in publick or private, where and when God requires, is to ſin againſt the Crown upon the Altar, which is the Authority of God, and to incur the diſpleaſure of God, and indeed to be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93772:50"/> guilty of any wilful raſhneſs or neglect in this buſineſs, is the ready way for a man to lay himſelf open to great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the hand of the Lord, <hi>Jer. 11. 3. Curſed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this Covenant,</hi> ſo <hi>Jer. 48. 10. Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O therefore ſoul remember that the Altar-worſhip hath its Crown above upon it, which ſignifyeth the Authors Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Law, which requireth thy ſubmiſſion or ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, ſo as to be careful thou proveſt not a wilful corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or neglector of the Worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Again, in the Tabernacle was the Mercy-ſeat placed, which had two Cherubims at the two ends of it, whoſe faces looked towards the Mercy-ſeat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37 67, 89.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By the Mercy-ſeat placed in the Tabernacle, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be meant the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe bloud and merits is the ground of Gods great manifeſtations of love and grace to the Elect, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. Cor. 5. 19. God was in Chriſt Reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> Mark, God was in Chriſt, that is, in his humane nature, appearing through it to men as he did through the Mercy-ſeat of old, <hi>Rom. 5. 9, 10. We are ſaved from wrath through Chriſt by being juſtified by his bloud, for when we were enemies we were Reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life;</hi> ſo that you ſee Chriſt the Mercy-ſeat is the ground of all the grace, love, mercy and Reconciliation which from the Father comes home to the Elect, I mean a procuring ground, not the efficient or firſt moving ground. In a word, this Mercy-ſeat ſhews us what Chriſt is in all reſpects to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, could we pick it out of this Myſtery; and it takes in all that Chriſt is or was anointed to be or to do for his Church and people, it takes in Chriſts bloud, Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, Chriſts righteouſneſs, Chriſts ſatisfaction given to the Father, Chriſts Life, Chriſts Death, Chriſts being in the Grave, Chriſts Aſcenſion, Chriſts Prieſthood, Chriſts preſent work of Interceſſion now in Heaven, Chriſts Offices, as King, Prieſt, and Prophet to and for his people, for their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93772:50"/> good and comfort forever; all this and more do the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat in <hi>Exod.</hi> 37. Comprehend and ſhadow forth to us for our inſtruction, ſo that believers ſhould look on all the diſpenſations of God towards them, (be they ſweet or bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) always flowing forth to them from the Mercy-ſeat or place of Reconcilement, the ſeat where God always ſits when he hath to do with believers, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>2 Cor. 5. 19 God in Chriſt Reconc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ling the world to himſelf,</hi> ſo <hi>Rom. 8. 32. He that ſpareth not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things:</hi> Its all mercy, love, and grace which comes from God to his people, becauſe it comes forth from God through the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat Chriſt, though the providence may be mixed with never ſo much ſharpneſs or bitterneſs, yet it ſhall end in mercy, for it comes in mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. We know that all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God; to them who are called according to his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas it is ſaid that the faces of the Cherubims ſtill looked towards the Mercy-ſeat, it ſhews us how the whole Trinity doth agree together and accord in the good of Gods Elect, for I look on this Figure as an Emblem of the belſſed union of the three perſons, of Father, Son, and holy Spirit, my looking on this is by way of alluſion, the Mercy-ſeat to be meant of Chriſt the ſecond Perſon, the two Cherubims to be meant of the Father and holy Spirit proceeding both from Father and Son, ſo that as the faces of the two Cherubims were placed with their eyes towards the Mercy-ſeat, it ſhews us thus much, that what good God the Father did will the Elect before time, and what grace, and mercy, and love the holy Ghoſt did manifeſt, make known, and reveal to the Elect in time by ſpiritual applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all this ariſeth from Chriſts merits, bloud, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as the procuring cauſe of all; to this agreeth the words of St. <hi>Peter, Pet. 1. 1, 2. Elect according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God the Father</hi> (mark there is the act of the firſt perſon) <hi>through the ſanctification of the ſpirit,</hi> (there is the act
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93772:51"/> of the third perſon) <hi>unto obedience and ſprinkling of the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (there is the act of the ſecond perſon as the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cauſe and ground of all) Or thus:</p>
                  <p>By the two Cherubims at the two ends of the Mercy-ſeat; we many underſtand Chriſts ſtanding between God and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his Juſtice in our ſtead and for our ſakes, that God might look on the Law through Chriſt as fulfilled by him for our ſakes and in our behalf; yet take this Caution along with you, that although the Mercy-ſeat with its two Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims may be alluded unto as a Figure of the concurring agreement of the three perſons (Father, Son, and holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) in and about the Salvation of the Elect; yet this proves not a ground for any to attempt the making of any Image or ſimilitude of either perſons in the Trinity, ſo as to Woſhip them by, as the Papiſt blindly dream, for its ſaid in <hi>Deut. 4. 15 That there was no ſimilitude ſeen in the Mount,</hi> ſo that what ever have been ſaid of the three perſons through the above ſaid ſimilitudes, are not to be underſtood as Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of his Divine Eſſence, but of the works of God, which are thoſe ſeveral manifeſtations of grace, which through Chriſt he applys to the Elect by his ſpirit. So much as to the bleſſed Myſtery of the Cherubims placed in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle at the two ends of the Mercy-ſeat.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. 18. I</hi> now come to ſpeak of the place where the Ark did lie in the Tabernacle.</head>
               <p>THe place appointed for the Ark to ſtand in while in the Tabernacle, it was under the Mercy-ſeat, for we read in <hi>Exod.</hi> That when <hi>Moſes</hi> had put the Tables (wherein the ten Commandments were written) into the Ark, then did he take the Ark and carry it into the Tabernacle, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it under the Mercy ſeat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 20. Then took he a veil and ſpread over it for a covering that it might not be ſeen, ver. 21.</p>
               <p>Now the great Myſtery of this Type or Figure, I conceive to be this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the ten Commandments written in the Tables of the Ark, I underſtand for the matter of it to be meant the Covenant of works which God made with all men (in their Repreſentative <hi>Adam</hi>) in Paradiſe, which Covenant we have all broken, and ſo lie under the penalties of the breach of this Covenant in our ſelves for ever, <hi>John 3 36. Rom 5. 12.</hi> Which Covenant came Jeſus Chriſt to fulfil in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt exaction of it; for all that ever Chriſt did or ſuffered in the fleſh was to give this Covenant its full ſatisfaction in our behalf, if we prove to be true believers, <hi>Rom. 10. 4. Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſse to every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now by <hi>Moſes</hi> his putting the fiery Law in the Ark under the Mercy ſeat, I underſtand theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the moral Law as it is a Law or Rule of life to a Chriſtian, is not ceaſed as ſome would have it go, you ſee
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93772:52"/> it was not thrown away but only hid under the Mercy-ſeat, and the hiding of it was what had relation to God more then to the people, the hiding of the Law was to put out of Gods ſight, that he might never ſee it more, it was not hid that believers ſhould never ſee it more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was to ſhew us that the condemning, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and eternal deſtroying power of the Law (as it was the Law of the old Covenant, and ſo a Law not ſatisfied for) I ſay, it was to ſhew that this Covenant or Law was taken away by the ſatisfaction which was given by Chriſt, that as the Law made the creature before to ſubject to its terrours, now Chriſt hath made the Law to ſubject to his merits, for you ſee the Law is forced to lie under the Mercy-ſeat: And beſides it ſhews us thus much for the great comfort of all believers, that God cannot look upon any of believers any more as in or under the old Covenant, becauſe the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant lieth hid under the Mercy-ſeat; now if it did ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mercy-ſeat, then indeed when at any time God had caſt his eyes about upon the Mercy-ſeat it would have been the firſt thing that God would have had in his eyes. But to prevent that it is a Law hid out of ſigh, a Law that muſt not appear before God, a Law that muſt lie under the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat, a Law veiled up in the Mantle of rich and free grace, that if God will at any time caſt his eyes about that way where the Covenant lieth, God muſt look through a whole heap of ſatisfaction before he can eſpie this old Covenant, therefore ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom. 8. 1. There is therefore now no condemnation to thoſe which are in Chriſt, who walk not after the fleſh,</hi> ſo <hi>Jer. 50. 20. In that time,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>ſhall the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Iſarel be ſought for, and there ſhall be none, and the ſins of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and they ſhall not be found, for</hi> I <hi>will pardon them whom I reſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the queſtion will be, that if the moral Law was a Law hid out of ſight and veiled up ſo as you ſpeak, then whether or no believers are to take any notice of it at all,</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Its true indeed, as the moral Law was for the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93772:52"/> matter of it the old Covenant of works, ſo its a Covenant or Law hid from believers, and in this ſenſe a believer hath nothing to do with the Law, nor the Law with a believer; but when Jeſus Chriſt on the believers part had fulfilled and ſatisfied the Law as it was formally the old Covenant, he takes up the matter of the old Covenant which is the ten Commandments, and makes it the Law of his Kingdom, and ſo Impoſeth it on his people as a Rule to walk by for ever in their ſeveral Generations; but with differing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects in compariſon to what the Law was to be ſubjected unto before, for when the ten Commandments (as it was for the matter of it, the Covenant of works) called for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from the creature before it was for life, ſaying, <hi>Do this and thou ſhalt live, if not thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> But as its become (for the matter of it) the Law of a Mediatour, and a Law in Chriſts hand, and ſo a Law which comes forth to us from under the Mercy-ſeat, it ſpeaks otherwiſe then it did before, not for life, but from life, not that you might live, but becauſe you do live, not that you might get-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but becauſe heaven is freely given unto you and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon you. The Law in Chriſts hand doth not ſay you muſt repent and mourn for ſin and get it mortified, and be humbled and holy, that God might love you and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſin in you, and that he might give you an inheritance amongſt them which are ſanctified, but becauſe all this is freely procured by Jeſus Chriſt for you already, and is freely by the grace of God made over to the ſoul as his through ſound believing, <hi>Like 1. 74, 75, That we being delivered</hi> (mark that) not that we might be delivered, <hi>might ſerve him without fear, in righteouſneſs and holineſſe all the dayes of our lives,</hi> ſo <hi>Hebrewes 12. 28. Wherefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved</hi> (mark that) a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom already received, <hi>Let us have grace whereby we may ſerve God with reverence and godly fear,</hi> ſo <hi>Titus 2. 11, 12. The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation hath appeared to all men,</hi> (mark that) which hath already appeared, <hi>This teack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93772:53"/> them that denying ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily, in this preſent world;</hi> So that a believer is ſo far from being ſet free by Chriſt from the Law or ten Commandments, as that he is the more obliged to the ſtrict obſervation of it; Therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Romans 3. 31. Do we then make void the Law through faith, God forbid, yea we eſtabliſh the Law,</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans 7. 12. <hi>Wherefore the Law is holy, and the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holy, juſt, and good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The form of the Old Covenant is taken away by Chriſt from a Believer, but the matter ſtill remains, itceaſeth to be a Law commanding for life to a Believer, but it ſtill requires obedience in all manner of Coverſation at a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers hands, becauſe he doth live; and ſo its a Rule to walk by as binding as ever.</p>
               <p>Thus you may ſee if you will but conſider the place where the Tables of the Law were placed, they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Ark, which Ark typed out Chriſt as you have heard before, ſo that by <hi>Moſes</hi> his placing the Tables of the moral Law in the Ark under the Mercy-ſeat, both which places being types of Chriſt, it is very clear that the moral Law or ten Commandments are become the Law of Chriſts mediatory Kingdom.</p>

               <p>THis Table called the Shew-bread Table was placed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in one ſide of the tabernacle, <hi>Exod. 40. 22.</hi> The uſe of this Table was to hold the bread called the Shew-bread, this bread was made into little loaves or cakes, and ſet upon the Table, and they were in number twelve, which was proportionable to the number of their tribes. The bread was ſet in two Rows upon the Table, ſix on one ſide and ſix on the other ſide of the Table. The bread was ſet new on the Table every Sabbath day, and when the new was to be ſet on the Table, the Prieſts were to eat the old, as you may ſee in <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Now this bread was typical two ways, and both held out Chriſt to the people.</p>
               <p>Firſt. It figured forth Chriſt one who conſtantly abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth under the eye of God for the people, or in the behalf of beliervers; for as the Shew-bread was always to ſtand on the Table before the Lord, therefore called the Shew-bread, ſo Jeſus Chriſt (who is called <hi>The bread of life, John</hi> 6. 35.) Is never off the Fathers ſight in the behalf of believers, in whoſe humane nature the Father was fully ſatisfied, and in whom he profeſſeth himſelf to be well-pleaſed with us, <hi>Mat. 3. 17. This is my beloved Son in whom I am well-pleaſed.</hi> Chriſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in readineſs to preſent his Father with the view of his Righteouſneſs on the Altar of his ſufferings, preſenting his Father with his nailed feet and hands, with his pierced ſides, with his hanging down head upon the Croſs, with his drops
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93772:54"/> of blood in the Garden with the pourings forth of his ſoul unto death, that ſo the ſight of theſe things might endear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to the heart of God.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe 1.</head>
                  <p>It may be ſome ſoul may think that he is caſt out of the ſight of God, and out of the favour and love of God. O but thy Chriſt is not, and ſo long it is well enough. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and recover thy ſelf with theſe thoughts; Chriſt thy Shew-bread abideth in Gods eye for ever, Chriſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtanding upon the Table of acceptation before God for thee: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 9. 24. Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, but into heaven it ſelf, there to appear in the preſence of God for us:</hi> And therefore ſoul, if thou haſt union with Chriſt, thou needeſt not doubt of thy condition; for if the Father do accept the head, certainly he cannot reject the members.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas the Shew-bread was put into twelve loaves, according to the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as that there was not a loaf more or leſs: This teacheth us, that though the number of thoſe that ſhall lay hold on Chriſt (by real faith) be many, yea, very many; yet they need not doubt, here is bread enough for them all; here is a loaf for every Tribe, a piece for every Chriſtian. O Chriſt is an inexhauſtible treaſure, which will not be waſted; a fountain which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be drawn dry, a loaf that can never be eaten; Although there hath been many a thouſand that have been a feeding upon Chriſts Fleſh and Blood, throughout all generations of the world; yet our Lord writes himſelf ſtill, <hi>Heb. 13. 8. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt tke ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, This Shew-bread ſignified the great bounty and goodneſs of God to the Iſraelites in their wilderneſs conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that he gave them to underſtand, that he could and would provide for them a table in a barren Land, where no corn was grown, that from thence they might be led the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93772:54"/> more to admire God in his power, love, and grace, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to them in that condition, and that their hearts might be raiſed up to a pitch of thankfulneſs: ſo likewiſe ſhould it teach Believers to make the ſame uſe of Gods bounty and goodneſs to them in the gift of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, that ſuch proviſion ſhould be made for them, that the Table of his grace and love ſhould be ſo deckt with the fleſh, blood, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and righteouſneſs of his own onely Son, as you have it in the parable, <hi>Luke 14. 16, 17. A certain man made a great ſupper, and bid many, and ſent his ſervant at ſupper time, to ſay to them that were bidden, Come, for all things are ready.</hi> Thus you ſee a great ſupper is provided, much proviſion made, a table furniſhed, no want at all on Gods part, all the want lieth on our parts, we are not ready. O how ſhould this cauſe Chriſtians to admire God in his wonderful acts of grace to their ſouls, that as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>John 3. 16. He ſhould ſo love the world, as to ſend into it his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever ſeeth him, and ſhall believe in him ſhall have everlasting life.</hi> And with 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 1. To break forth into a holy admiration, and cry out, <hi>O what manner of love is this that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. 19.</hi> I ſhall in the next place ſpeak of the Candleſtick which was placed in the Tabernacle.</head>
               <p>IN this Tabernacle there was placed a Candleſtick which was made of pure Gold, and the faſhion of it was thus. It parted from a foot high in the ſtem into ſix branches, three of the branches going one way, and three of the branches going another way, there were three bowls made like unto three almonds, with their knobs and their flowers to every branch; but in the ſtem of the Cnadleſtick below their parting were four bowls with their knobs and their flowers, <hi>Exod. 27. 17. Exod 37. 18, 19, 20.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Candleſtick in this place we are to underſtand to be meant the Church of God; which Church is made up of true Believers, which truly and ſincerely profeſs and own Chriſt and his Worſhip, being redeemed by his Blood from all the earth, <hi>Rev. 7. 14.</hi> This is the ſignification of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick; the truth of which you may read, <hi>Rev. 1. 20.</hi> where the ſeven Churches are compared to ſeven golden Candleſticks, which anſwereth to the Candleſtick in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, for that was made of pure beaten Gold, <hi>Ex. 27. 17.</hi> Now the Church of God may be compared to a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſeveral manner of wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As a Candleſtick is made to mount or hold up the light, that all in a time of darkneſs may ſee, ſo doth the Church and people of God, they hold up the light of truth, and the bright ſhinings of the word and Goſpel, that all that are in the dark world, who ſit in the Region and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, might behold the face of God in Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93772:55"/> ſhining through the Saints gifts, graces, and holy converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in upon their ſouls, <hi>Iſaiah 2. 3. The Law ſhall go forth out of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem:</hi> by which means, <hi>Iſa. 9. 2. The people that walked in darkneſs have ſeen a great light, and they that dwelled in the land of the ſhadow of death upon them hath the light ſhined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though this latter propheſie doth principally belong to Chriſt, yet it is to be applied to his Church alſo; for its through them Chriſt ſhineth upon the dark world: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith our Saviour to his Disſciples, <hi>Matth. 5. 14. Ye are the light of the world,</hi> meaning, they were the Candleſtick prepared of God to hold up and hold out the light of truth to the dark, blinde, miſerable world.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe. 1.</head>
                  <p>This informs then what a deal of duty lieth upon the Church, both Miniſters as well as others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For Miniſters, what care ſhould they take, and what pains ſhould they expoſe themſelves unto, in order to the keeping up, and holding forth the light and word of the Goſpel to the dark nations of the earth: what care did <hi>Paul</hi> take to fulfil his miniſtry, and to diſcharge his duty this way, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 24. He counted not his life dear unto himſelf, ſo that he could fulfil his miniſtry with you, which miniſtration he had received from the Lord Jeſus; and that he might be uſeful this way, you may take notice of <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20. I <hi>have kept back nothing which was profitable to you, but have ſhewed you and taught you openly, and throughout every houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But O good God, how few ſuch houſe preaching lights doth the eart afford us in this our age; but contrariwiſe, inſtead of men that ſhould make it their buſineſs with <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, to go from houſe to houſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the dark fami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies of the earth in the knowledge of God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt: they rather bend their forces, parts, wits, and purſes, to darken and put out the light of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93772:56"/> truth, and the knowledge of God in all the families they meet withal where they go, like unto thoſe teachers of old ſpoken of in <hi>Ezek. 34. 18, 19. Seemeth it a ſmall thing unto you, to have eaten up the good paſture, but ye muſt tread down with your feet the reſidue of your paſtures; and to have drunk of the deep waters, but you muſt foul the reſidue with your feet; and as for my flock they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.</hi> How far theſe, or ſuch as theſe are from being of the true Candleſtick appointed to hold up and hold out the light of truth in the world, let the reader judge.</p>
                  <p>But again, this ſhould teach all the Saints (for they are a part of the Candleſtick alſo) to endeavour in their ſeveral places and callings to promote the glory of God in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, to ſtudy godlineſs, and which way they may be uſeful with their gifts and graces, amongſt their relations and neighbours, and in their families, in order to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of their ſouls to Jeſus Chriſt: therefore ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Mat. 5, 16. Let pour light ſo ſhine before men, that they ſeeing your good works might glorifie your Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> To this agreeth the words of <hi>Paul. Phil.</hi> 2 16. with ch. 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. He exhorts all true Chriſtians, that they would labour to hold forth the word of life, and that they would labour to live unblameable in their lives, and ſpotleſs in their converſations, and that they would keep themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rebuke in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, amongſt whom they were to ſhine as lights: ſo verſe 16. The reaſon of the former exhortation is given you, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they are to hold forth the word of life, even as a Candleſtick they are to hold up or hold forth the light of truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A candleſtick is appointed to hold faſt as wel as to hold up the light, that it fall not down, becauſe the fall of which many times puts out the light; ſo is the Church of God prepared and fitted to ſuccour and keep up the light of Gods holy truth in the earth, that it might not be thrown
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93772:56"/> down by the malice of the devil and wicked men, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour night and day to put it out in the world.</p>
                  <p>There be two wayes by which God fitteth the Church as a Candleſtick to keep up the light of truth in the world.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is by pouring forth upon them the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by vertue of which they are enabled to diſcover; detect, and finde out all errour, and whatſoever may be contrary to ſound doctrine, as in <hi>Rev. 2. 2. Thou haſt tried them which ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and hast found them lyars.</hi> Hence it is that the adverſaries of truth are ſaid not to be able to reſiſt the wiſdom and ſpirit, by which St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpake, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 10. The reaſon you may perceive lay in this, the Church of which <hi>Stephen</hi> was a member, had a very great meaſure of the gifts of the Spirit, which came upon them but a little before, read <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. God fits his Church as a Candleſtick to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and hold up the light of his holy truth in the world, is by pouring forth upon their hearts the grace of his Spirit, that ſo they might be enabled to ſuffer for it.</p>
                  <p>The Saints ſuffering for truth doth wonderfully tend to the confirming of truth in the earth, and to the making of it acceptable amongſt men in this world; inſomuch, that in the firſt three hundred years after Chriſt, the Churches ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for the truth occaſioned this proverb, That the blood of Martyrs was the ſeed of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that the ſuffering Saints are called Gods wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells you that the truth got great ground by his ſufferings, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe 1.</head>
                  <p>O then how ſhould this teach the Lords people to beſtir themſelves in the way of their duty. O remember, ye are God Candleſtick, and appointed by God for this purpoſe, to keep up truth in the world: O then how ſhould this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Lords people to appear in the defence of that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93772:57"/> glorious light of truth, which God hath put into your hands, and not to ſuffer it to be trodden down with ſo much eaſe as it is now in the world. I do not mean, nor ſay, that the Lords people ſhould betake themſelves to any weapon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides faith, tears, prayers, and ſound arguments, together with a bold ſtanding up in the viſible practice of the wayes and truths of God againſt all that is contrary to this truth: Theſe be the weapons that I mean, and this is the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I plead for: and as to this way of contending for the Faith, what cauſe hath God to complain of his people, as once he did of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>No man is valiant for the truth.</hi> O what little contending is there (amongſt Saints) for the faith that was once delivered to them: O what ſilly heartleſs dove-like ſpirits are the Lords people ſurprized withal, who can ſit and hear the truths of the Goſpel rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in pieces before their eyes, and in their hearing, and not a word ſpoken for it, or in the defence of it; but inſtead thereof, they out of a ſlaviſh fear do but too much comply with the wicked in it.</p>
                  <p>O brethren, the precious truths of <hi>Sion</hi> are more worth then ſo, more worth then not to have one word ſpoken for them. O remember, the Church is to contend for the faith, and know that God will deeply charge home the neglect of this duty one day cloſe upon your ſouls.</p>
                  <p>O therefore as you would avoid that judgement ſpoken of in the third of the <hi>Revelations, ver.</hi> 16. I beſeech you brethren to labour to give up your ſelves to a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the faith. O earneſtly contend for the faith, there is great reaſon ſo to do; for the name of God is upon the Faith, the Blood of Chriſt was ſhed for this faith, the blood of all the Martyrs in all ages in the world hath been ſhed for this faith: O the faith that was once delivered to the Saints is worth the contending for. O that God would ſtir up your hearts to an earneſt contending for the faith. O ſet a work a praying ſpirit, and a believing ſpirit. O ſet on work your parts, your pens, your purſes, every way as you are able, (if the way be warrantable) do you contend for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93772:57"/> the faith which was once delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This Candleſtick was made of pure gold, this was to teach the Saints what they ſhould and ought to be; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure gold, that is very ſincere to God ward, void of a heart full of guile and hypocriſie, therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 5. 48. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e ye therefore perfect as your heavenly father is perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This Candleſtick was made of beaten gold, which was to ſhew or ſet forth the glory and the excellency of the Church, for as gold exceeds for glory and excellency Iron, Lead, Tinne, or Braſs, ſo do the Saints all other men and women in the world; Therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 16. 3. The Saints are the excellent of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the blind world ſee no worth or excellency in the Saints in this life, yet they ſhall know (as <hi>Solomon</hi> once ſaid) that the Righteous is more excellent then his Neighbour, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 26.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The righteous is more excellent then his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For their attendance, for not gilded creatures, but glorious Angels are the Saints ſervants, <hi>Heb. 1. 14.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For the Saints food on which they live, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of which all the dainties in the world, or which the world lives upon, are but husks and ſwines meat, for the Saints live upon the Bloud, and Fleſh, Word, Spirit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6. 55.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Saints are more excellent then others in point of inheritance, for its not an earthly Dunghil, but an inheritance <hi>which is pure and undefiled, which fadeth not away is the Saints birthright, Pet. 1. 1, 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiſthly, The Saints are more excellent then others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they only can prevail upon the heart of God in prayer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 29.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Its ſo becauſe its only amongſt the Saints <hi>God delights to dwel, 2 Cor. 6. 16. Pſal. 132 13, 14.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe 1.</head>
                  <p>O then what excellent Converſation ſhould the Saints lead in this world, what an engagement ſhould this put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93772:58"/> the Saints to a ſtrict holy walking, that they ſhould (through grace) be made of Gods pure golden Candleſtick.</p>
                  <p>O therefore ſoul, think with thy ſelf, when the Devil would at any time intice thee to ſin againſt God, or would draw away thy heart at any time from the Lord, O ſay this to thy temptation. O Satan I am one that belongs to Gods pure Candleſticks, how ſhould I dare to beſpot my ſelf with the leaſt of impurities, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> anſwered his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, <hi>Gen. 39. 9.</hi> So do thou thy temptation, How ſhall I do ſuch a wickedneſs and ſin againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Again, As the Candleſtick had three Bouls and Knops with their flowers upon it. This was for Ornament to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Candleſtick that ſo it might the more appear in its glory and beauty to the beholder; all which was to ſet forth the glory and beauty of the Church of God, which by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt and the Divine Graces of his Spirit, is made more glorious then the gold of Ophir, read <hi>Pſal. 45. 13, 14. Iſa 54. 11, 12. Rev. 12. 1.</hi> The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches glory is only diſcerned by an eye of believing, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal underſtanding knows very little of this, ſaith <hi>John</hi> 1. 3, 1. The world knows us not, certainly were not the glory of the Saints a hidden veiled up glory from the world; its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but the Saints would be better intreated at the worlds hands then they are, but however thou fareſt at the worlds hands, let me adviſe thee to theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If the world ſhew thee and the reſt of the Saints no favour, yet pity them, becauſe they are held ſo much in a condition of darkneſſe, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. The God of this world hath blinded their minds, leaſt the light of the glorious Goſpel ſhould ſhine in upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Labour to comfort thy ſelf from this good conſideration, under all the ignomy and reproach which the world will or can caſt upon thee, that the time is coming which (will not ſtay long) wherein the Lord will make thine with the reſt of his peoples glory, to ſhine forth with more brightneſſe and Majeſty then the Sun in its full ſtrength;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93772:58"/> that although thou with the reſt of the Saints haſt lain (for a while) amongſt the pots, yet the time will not be long, <hi>But thy wings ſhall be as a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve covered over with ſilver, and all thy feathers of yellow gold,</hi> Pſal. 68. 13.</p>
                  <p>Again, in this Candleſtick we may obſerve theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The parting of the Candleſtick, which was in this maner, it parted a foot high or thereabouts in the ſtem.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Out of which parting came ſix Branches, which ſhews us thus much, the great Candleſtick out of which the little Candleſticks branched forth, ſignifies the Jewiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, this holds as intire from the foot of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick to the parting above in the ſtem, out of which ſtem came the ſix Branches; and the Branches ſignifie the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Churches which ſucceeded or ſprung forth from the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church, <hi>Iſa. 60. 3. The Gentiles ſhall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightneſs of thy riſing.</hi> Pray obſerve the thing well, there were not ſix little Candleſticks branched beſides and apart from the great Candleſtick, but ſix little Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks branched themſelves forth of the great Candleſtick, but ſtill maintained union with the great Candleſtick, which ſhews us theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That both Jews and Gentiles are but one people to God, (conſider the Jews as they were befre they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by unbelief) and all intereſted in one Chriſt alike, all that did believe, either Jew or Gentile ſhall all ſit down in one Kingdom of God together, <hi>Rom. 10. 12. For there is no difference, but the ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It ſhews us thus much, that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jew and Church was not eſſential, but circumſtantial, not ſo much in the ſtate as in the Ordinances. Pray obſerve, the Candleſticks all hold union in the ſtem, although they differed above in the Branches: Its true, the Lord held the Jews and Gentiles under differing adminiſtrations, but not under a divers ſtate, they and we differed in our Ordinances, but not in eſſence or ſubſtance as to a Church ſtate, ſo much
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93772:59"/> as this clearly offers it ſelf to me from the union between the ſtem and the Branches in the Candleſtick, if it will be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Candleſtick in the Tabernacle be a figure of the Church of God, as then it was, together with theſe other Gentile Churches which ſhould ſucceed that; now conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Scriputres elſewhere do ſo apply the word Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, I know not but this ſhould paſs for a fair notion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 20. Where its ſaid that the Myſtery of the ſeven golden Candleſticks are the ſeven Churches. You ſee the Candleſtick in the Tabernacle for Eſſence and Subſtance was one and the ſame, though they differed above in the Branches; ſo then if this be a figure of the Church of God under both Old and New Teſtament, then both the Jews then, and we Gentles now, muſt ſtand upon one and the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame ſtock or root, or elſe how doth this hold good in the ſimilitude, for after the ſame manner reaſons the Apoſtle about the Jewiſh and Gentile Churches, <hi>Rom. 11. 24. For if thou wert cut out of the Olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into the good Olive tree, how much more ſhall theſe which be the natural Branches be grafted into their own Olive tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Methinks then how clearly do this warrant the practice of the Congregational Churches in giving to their Infants Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip in their Church, and conſequently Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>I know there are many of our dear Chriſtian friends (in <hi>England</hi>) of a differing opinion to me in this matter, but how ever read my notion without offence, and then give thy thoughts about it.</p>
                  <p>Now mark, there is nothing more clear to me from the union that the Branches hold to and with the Candleſtick, but that the Jews and we Gentiles were taken into a Church ſtate alike, ſo ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom. 11. 16.</hi> with ver. 24. <hi>For if the firſt fruit be holy, the lump is alſo holy, if the root be holy ſo are the branches, and if thou wert cut out of the Olive-tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into the good Olive-tree, how much more ſhall theſe which be the natural
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93772:59"/> branches be grafted into their own olive tree.</hi> From hence I ſhall take leave to ask a queſtion or two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What may we underſtand by the root and the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches laid down here by St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, What may we underſtand by this holineſs with which the branches were made holy, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. and what theſe branches were.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, by the root and branches muſt be meant ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt, together with all thoſe ſound Believers which are ingrafted into him by true Faith; or elſe by the root and branches muſt be meant a Church ſtate, and all thoſe viſible branches which ſtand there by memberſhip: Now if we ſhould underſtand it in the firſt ſence, then this will follow, that thoſe that are truly ingrafted into Chriſt by faith, may be wholly broken off; and ſo we muſt run our ſelves upon Arminianiſme do what we can: But if we muſt not take it in the former ſence, then we muſt take it in the latter ſence: (<hi>viz.</hi>) by the root and branches, a Church ſtate, and thoſe which are taken in the viſible memberſhip of it, for ſuch may be broken off, or may fall away (conſider them meerly as Church Members) and no truth, or part of the truth of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction impared: Now what were the branches of the root (which root was the Jewiſh Church ſtate) were they not the parents and the children, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en.</hi> 17. Well then, if theſe were the branches of the old root, <hi>viz.</hi> the believing parents and their children, and that the Gentiles are ingrafted into, or upon the ſame root, and are partakers of the fatneſs of the old olive tree, meaning the priviledges of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And if the candleſtick of the Jews holds union with the Candleſtick of the Gentiles (under the Goſpel) in the ſame ſtem, how then can our Church ſtate under the Goſpel be like the Jews under the Old Teſtament, if onely we ſhould ſtand as Members in a Church ſtate without our little ones: but again, mark what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 11. 16. For if the firſt fruits be holy, the lump is alſo holy: if the root be holy ſo are the branches;</hi> ſo that the ſecond queſtion will be this
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93772:60"/> what may we underſtand by holineſs here, or in what ſence ſhall we take it; either it muſt be a holineſs conſiſting of the divine graces of the Spirit, or elſe it muſt be a holineſs ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from a Church ſtate; and in this ſence were the Jews called a holy nation, and a peculiar people, which aroſe from their being ſet apart by God to holy uſes and purpoſes to God himſelf; or if you will take it in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> terms, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. A holineſs in oppoſition to uncleanneſs, which uncleanneſs is elſewhere proved to conſiſt of not being of a profeſſed Church ſtate to God; read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 1. with <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 14. For it could not be a holineſs with which the whole body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were made holy; that conſiſts of the divine qualifications of the Spirit of grace: I think but few are of that opinion, that the whole body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in ſuch a ſence holy: then it muſt be a holineſs ariſing from a Church State; as if he had ſaid, <hi>If the firſt fruit be holy,</hi> that is, if <hi>Abraham</hi> with his <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> together with the reſt of his family, who were first (with all their ſucceeding little ones) taken into a Church ſtate, and ſo became the firſt fruits of ſuch a work to God, <hi>The lump is holy,</hi> that is, then the whole body of that people is holy with reference to a Church ſtate, they need not call it in queſtion. But if they keep cloſe to God, certainly God accounts the iſſue of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for many generations after, as much in a holy ſtate (as to a Church ſtate) and as much a Church to himſelf, both they and their little ones, as ever he accounted it in the firſt fruits of it, meaning in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, <hi>The lump, ſaith Paul, is alſo h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly.</hi> Then he comes to conclude, that if the firſt fruits were holy, which were the parent and the childe, <hi>And if the lump be holy,</hi> that is, if God to this day have accounted the whole body of the Jews ever ſince in the ſame Church ſtate, which admitted of the parent and the childe, then are the branches holy, <hi>viz.</hi> The Gentile Churches which were ingrafted in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ſtock; then the childe as well as the parent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on upon this ſtock as formerly, are likewiſe hily ſtill: ſo that from what hath been ſpoken doth (to me) clearly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93772:60"/> warrant the congregational people the giving of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren memberſhip amongſt them, and conſequently baptiſm. Let not any miſtake me, I did not this to revive any part of the old contention, or to beget any new quarrel between us and thoſe Chriſtians which diſſent from us in this thing; but as I conceived things lay ſo in my way, that I muſt have leapt quite over a clear truth if I had left it and ſo paſſed by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, upon the ſame account, will a national Church be proved to be lawful, even the ſame way that the memberſhip of Infants will come in?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer firſt, I know no abſolute neceſſity lying upon the thing, ſo as that we muſt not diſpute for or practice the one but the other muſt come in, you ſee in the practice of the Congregational Churches, both here and in <hi>New England,</hi> that the connexion is not forcible, but that we may give our Children Memberſhip and Baptiſm amongſt us, and yet be far enough from building our Churches upon a National bottom.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, And that which will lead me to the other conſideration in the Candleſtick, which is this: The candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick you know had one ſtem, out of which came ſix bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The ſtem of the Candleſtick ſignifies the Jewiſh Church, and the little Candleſticks which came out of that, ſignifies the Gentile Churches under the Goſpel: the ſtem of the Candleſtick was but one individual, ſhewing that the Church of the Jews was to be national: But the branches above in the Candleſtick were ſeveral in number, ſignifying that the Churches under the Goſpel day, ſhould be no more national but congregational, To this agreeth the two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of <hi>Zechariah</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who writing both about one and the ſelf-ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> about the two Witneſſes, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 3. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 3, 4. Onely <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſayes, That at that time when he writ about the two Witneſſes belonging to the Jewiſh Church, he ſaw but one Candleſtick, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 2 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the Church was national: but when <hi>John</hi> writ of the Witneſſes in the Gentile or Goſpel Church, he ſaw two
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93772:61"/> Candleſticks, or ſeveral Candleſticks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 4. Becauſe now the Churches of Chriſt were no more to be national, but congregational, or many Churches in one nation.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more to be ſpoken to, about the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick, and I have done with it. You may obſerve in reading, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37. 18, 19, 20, 21. This plain difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Candleſticks, which is, that the main Candleſtick had four bowls, with his knobs and his flowers belonging to it; but the leſſer Candleſticks which branched themſelves forth of the great Candleſtick had but three Bowls, with their knobs and their flowers. Now you muſt obſerve (as hath been already ſaid) that the bowls, knobs, and flowers added to the Candleſtick, it was to ſet ſorth the glory of it: then where the moſt of the bowls, knobs, and flowers were, there was the greateſt glory: but now the moſt of theſe things were about the great Candleſtick, which ſhews us thus much, that although the Jewiſh Church did at firſt fall ſhort of the Gentile Churches in glory and brightneſs; yet the time ſhall come that the glory of the Jewiſh Church ſhall far excel all the Gentile Churches in the world, <hi>Iſa. 54. 11, 12. O thou afflicted and toſſed with tempeſt and not comforted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will lay thy ſtones with fair colours, and lay thy foundation with ſaphires, I will make thy windows of agats, thy gates of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, and all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. 21.</hi> I now come to ſpeak of the ſeven Lamps (which with the Candleſtick) were placed in the Tabernacle.</head>
               <p>THere were likewiſe ſeven lamps made of pure gold, <hi>Ex.</hi> 37. 23. which Lamps were to be lighted, and always to be kept burning before the Lord, <hi>Exodus</hi> 40. 25. In which, there are theſe things to be conſidered, or it may put us in minde of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The veſſel it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly the oyl in the Veſſel, or Lamp.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The light it gave out to the beholders.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the Lamp or Veſſel it ſelf, it may put us in mind of this great mercy, which by Grace Believers hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at Gods hands, and that is a ſanctified heart, into which God pours forth the holy oyl of his Spirit in the ſeveral gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it; by which means the heart is changed, purged, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and made fit for God: Now in this ſence every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers heart may be ſaid to be a Lamp, therefore ſaith the Lord in the Propheſie of <hi>Jer. 31. 33. I will put my Law in their hearts, and write it in their inward parts:</hi> ſo <hi>Ezek. 36. 26.

               </p>
               <p>O how excellent is that heart which is dedicated to the uſe and ſervice of God, that Lamp which was ſet apart for the ſervice of the Tabernacle was worth a hundred Lamps elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, becauſe the uſe and ſervice unto which it was dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

                  <p>O therefore how ſhould this teach the Lords people to look to their hearts, that nothing but the true Oil of the ſpirit of grace be found in it, you know the exhortation in <hi>Jer. 4. 14. O Jeruſalem waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee, for its the pure in heart ſhall ſee God, Mat. 5. 8</hi> Therefore when Temptation, Sin, or Luſt offers it ſelf to thy ſoul for entertainment; O baniſh it upon this very account, O ſay to ſin, my heart is become a dedicated Veſſel or Lamp to God, ſet apart for Altar-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and work, prepared for better matter then ſin is; O therefore ſin and corruption depart and get you hence, here is no entertainment for you, or for ſuch filthy matter as you are, ſaith <hi>David Pſal. 45. 1.

O therefore Sin, and Satan, the World, and Temptation, depart, depart, here is no entertainment for you for ever, I have found better food to live upon, and better objects to look unto then you are; therefore farwel for ever, farwel for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By the Lamps or Veſſels in the Tabernacle, which did hold the Oil which was to give out the light in the Tabernacle; I underſtand by them the Miniſters or gifted men in the Church, who are principally imployed to hold out the light of Gods holy will to the Church for the benefit and comfort of it; this you may ſee more plainly ſet out unto you in <hi>Zachaiahs</hi> propheſie, <hi>Zach. 4. 2. 3. I looked, and behold a Candleſtick of pure gold with a boul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Here you ſee the Prophet puts a clear difference between the Candleſtick and the ſeven Lamps, the Candleſtick and the Lamps are not one and the ſame thing: Now by the Candleſtick (as have been ſhewed already) is meant the Church of God, and by the ſeven Lamps on the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick muſt be meant the Miniſters and gifted men in the Church, which are gifted by the ſpirit of God for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of the Worſhip and Service of the Goſpel-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, both as to Doctrine and Diſcipline, for as the two Olive-trees, (<hi>Zach</hi> 4. 11, 12) Standing on each ſide of the Lamps, did convey their Oil through the ſeven Pipes into the ſeven Lamps, to continue their burning always in the Candleſtick, ſo do Jeſus Chriſt by his ſpirit (for Chriſt is called the tree of life, nd the apple tree, and the tree in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God) conſtantly conveying the ſap and oil of light and truth into his Lamps (the Miniſters)
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93772:63"/> through the Pipes of the Scriptures, or the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, for the information of the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks his Churches, therefore ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, 1. Tim.</hi> 4. 13. with 15. <hi>Untill I come give a tendance to Reading, Exhortation, and Doctrine, meditate on theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them that thy profitting may appear to all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if you compare <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 2. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 20. It will the more appear that the ſeven Lamps do intend the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church, and ſuch as are gifted for Church work, they are called there the ſeven Stars of the ſeven golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, that as Stars are fixed in the Firmament for the help of mankind (in the abſence of the Sun) againſt tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral darkneſs, ſo are the Miniſters ſet in the Firmament of the Church to help men in the abſence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They are ſaid to be ſeven Lamps, this number ſeven was given them, or the reaſon why the Lamps were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in number, its with reſpect to the plentifulneſs of the gifts of the ſpirit, which the Lord Jeſus doth pour out into his Church through theſe Lamps; for the word or number ſeven was a note of perfectneſs amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which they called a perfect number, ſo that by the ſeven Lamps we underſtand ſuch a plentiful meaſure of the ſpirit, and through ſupply of gifts as that there ſhall not be any wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>want of it in the Church upon any occaſion whatſoever, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enlighten, guide comfort, and ſtrengthen it unto its journeys end; therefore you have it <hi>Iſa. 27. 2, 3.

                  <p>O what a dreadful thing is it for one of theſe Lamps to wax out, or withdraw its ſhinings when the Church of God lieth ready to periſh for his not diſcharging his duty to them, for men to prove faint, careleſs, and negligent in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of duty in and to the Church, which God calls his Candleſtick; St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls this a being guilty of the bloud of fouls, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 26 You may likewiſe ſee what God doth account of this thing, read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3 20.</p>

                  <p>We have had ſufficient experience of this great evil of late years, into how many evils, and miſchiefs, and fearful Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſies have thouſands of profeſſours run themſelves upon, leaving their ſound Miniſters and Paſtours; O what horrid darkneſs hath their over-ſpread the minds of ſome profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours that would dare to profeſs an open ſeparation from their Paſtors and ſound teaching Miniſters, which were the Lamps of light and comfort which God in mercy held out to them.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Let this teach Chriſtians to love the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt; O keep this upon your heart daily, that the Miniſters of Chriſt are the Lamp lights to enlighten your ſouls in the time of darkneſs, our Saviour calls them the lights of the world, <hi>Mat. 5. 14. Ye are the light of the world,</hi> that is, ſuch as are appointed to guide the feet of the Saints into the way of peace; the Apoſtle ſays that the Miniſters of Chriſt are ſuch as watch for your ſouls, and muſt give an account for them to God in the laſt day, reade <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 13. 17.</p>

For I bear you record</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) that if it had been poſſible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me:</hi> Certainly if you looſe them, you will looſe the beſt of your eyes; O therefore bleſs God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, who hath yet continued his Lamp lights amongſt you, which yet maintain their burning and ſhining lights in the midſt of you, though it be wholly dark over Egypt, yet you have your Lamps burning in <hi>Goſher.</hi> O pray hard for them, O let Heaven ring with your cryes about your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, O put on for them as you would for your treaſure, your all, that God may yet ſtay them in the midſt of you.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. 22.</hi> A ſecond thing that I take notice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lamp, is the Oil which was in it.</head>
               <p>I Shall ſpeak the leſs of this, becauſe I have been handling the matter (in ſome meaſure) before, but for order ſake I ſhall give you a touch here.</p>
               <p>You know as hath been already obſerved, that a bare Lamp without Oil will not produce any light at all to any family or houſe in the world, therefore here is oil poured forth into the Lamp, and ſo it becomes a burning light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord always.</p>
               <p>Now you may eaſily conceive what this oil did ſignifie, if you will but conſider from whence it comes, read <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riahs</hi> propheſie, chap 4. 2, 3. with ver. 12. There you have the two Olive-trees ſtanding on the two ſides of the Pipes (which Pipes reached forth cloſe to the Lamps) emptying themſelves through the ſeven Pipes into the Lamps.</p>
               <p>Now by the two Olive-trees (though ſome may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture or think by them is meant the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament) I underſtand to be meant Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now that it cannot be the two Teſtaments of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which we muſt take for the two Olive-trees which poured their oil into the Lamps.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Scriptures of themſelves are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of giving out the leaſt drop of moiſture to any, therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them <hi>A dead Letter,</hi> meaning without the ſpirit.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:93772:66"/>
               <p>Secondly, It cannot be ſo, becauſe when <hi>Zachariah</hi> wrote this Myſtery, there was but one Teſtament written, for the new was not then given out; therefore I ſay, it muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Chriſt, Chriſt was both theſe Olive trees, both to the Jewiſh Church then, and to the Gentile Churches ever ſince; I mean ſuch of them as are Chriſts Churches indeed.</p>
               <p>Now let Jeſus Chriſt be conſidered in his two-fold nature, as God-Man, and ſo he will agree for number to the Olive Trees.</p>
               <p>Now its upon this account that Chriſt is ſuch a dropping fulneſs to the Church: Chriſt being thus conſidered in his two natures make him up to be the dropping Olive-Tree to the Lamps of the Church.</p>
               <p>For firſt, He muſt be God equal to the Father, that he might be capable to receive theſe communications from God, which are neceſſary for the Candleſtick his Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He muſt be man as well as God, that he might be capable to apply theſe (received communications from God) to the Church, or theſe that ſhall be the Lamps: therefore is Chriſt called the Emmanuel, or the God with us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 14. and in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. He is ſaid to be the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle perſon between God and us, therefore is Chriſt repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Scripture to be the treaſury, and ſtore-houſe of wiſdom and knowledge, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. And one in whom the fulneſs of the God-head dwelt bodily, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. And that it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell; but that of <hi>John</hi> is full to this purpoſe, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. with 16. <hi>The word was made fleſh, and it dwelt amongſt us, and we beheld his glory, as of the onely begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth:</hi> ſo <hi>ver. 16. And of his fulneſs have we all received, and grace for grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee Chriſt is the Olive Tree that firſt doth receive from the Father, and then drops his ſpiritual fatneſs down again to his Lamps, the Miniſters of the Goſpel, for the good of all the Church, which is called the Candleſtick; ſo that by the oyl is meant the rich gifts of the Spirit, which Chriſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93772:66"/> gives out to his Lamps the Miniſters, whereby they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to counſel and inſtruct the ignorant, to comfort the doubting, and ſtrengthen the feeble minded, to ſupport the weak, to feed the hungry, and correct the obſtinate, and warn the unruly, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the firſt of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 5. 14.</p>

                  <p>Then this ſhould teach Chriſtians to admire the Lord, who hath not with-held the beſt of ſupplies from his poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. O what greater love can there be thought on then this, who cannot but be ſwallowed up in the meditations of what God hath done for his Church, touching the daily benefits he drops down upon his people. O when we do conſider the rich droppings of the Spirit of God through Chriſt, which do daily come down on the Churches Lamps, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of the whole body; how can we chuſe but cry out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſalm 8. 4.

                  </p>
                  <p>O how largely hath God abounded this way of late years towards his people, what a wonderful deal of oyl hath he poured into his Churches Lamps, in this our day; whatever age could ſay the like as we can ſay, ſetting aſide the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles age O how hath the fountain of light and truth been broken up of late in the midſt of us, how have the little ones in <hi>Sion,</hi> been made to underſtand doctrine; what a high way hath there been ſet open in the things of God in our day, as that the way-faring men, though fools, have been kept from erring therein O that the Lords people would admire the love and grace of God herein, and that they would cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O the heighth, the depth, the length, and the breadth of the love of God which paſſeth knowledge, how unſearchable are his judgement, and his wayes paſt finding out.</hi>

                  <p>It informs us what rich food the people of God hath given them to live upon, which is better then all the rare dainties in the world beſide; when I think upon the pourings out of the Spirit of God, in the gifts and graces of it to the Churches of Chriſt: I do not ſo much wonder at the ſaying of the wiſe man, who tells us, that that little which the righteous hath is better then the large revenues of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 36. 16. Not onely becauſe the wicked have not their portion upon a divine account, or with ſuch a bleſſing as the godly have, but becauſe all that the wicked do enjoy of this world, were it ten times more then it is, yet it is nothing compared with the leaſt dram of the grace of the Spirit in the heart of a believer. O the honey ſweet manſions which believers feed upon. O the rare comforts they experience both by day and night, ſaith <hi>Paul 1 Cor. 2. 9. 10. Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive the things which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him, which things God revealed to his by his ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, one word of the Lamps more and I have done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them; and that is, It is ſaid that theſe Lamps were alwayes burning before the Lord, in which we may take notice of theſe two things.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>As to the firſt conſideration, I underſtand it to be meant of the aſſured continuance of the gifts and graces of the Spirit, for the benefit of the Elect of God in ſeveral ages of the world, that as the Lamps were never to go out in the Tabernacle, ſo the Lord will never be wanting with the gifts of his Spirit upon his Miniſters throughout all ages, that he might by and through them keep up the light and truth of his holy will in the world in deſpight of all oppoſition whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: read <hi>Pſalm 132. 15, 16, 17.

You ſee the lamp was alwayes to burn in the Tabernacle, ſo as certainly the light of truth ſhall and muſt alwayes burn in the world. Hence you have it in the Pſalms, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 132. 14. where God is ſpeaking of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick his Church, ſaith in theſe words, <hi>This is my reſt for ever, here will I dwell, for I have deſired it for my habitation.</hi>

                  <p>What an ingagement ſhould the thoughts of this doctrine of the lamps burning alwayes before the Lord, put upon the hearts of all Miniſters of the Goſpel to look to it, that there doctrine be ſound, and that which will hold weight before the Lord; if Miniſters doctrine do at any time carry more of their own water in it then Gods Wine certainly God will diſcover it: the Miniſters are Gods Lamps appointed for the Tabernacle, and they are to burn before the Lord; that is, they never act but Gods eye is upon what they do and preach in his Worſhip, to obſerve what comes from them, his eye is upon them in the ſtudying of their matter, while in the compoſing of it, and his eye is upon them in the Pulpit, while they are preaching of it: if there be iron and tin mixed with Gods gold and ſilver, ſurely the pure eyes of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will try it, of what ſort it is: therefore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>If any man build on this foundation, gold, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, precious ſtones, hay, wood, or ſtubble, every mans work ſhall be made manifeſt, for the day ſhall declare it, becauſe it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed or fire, and the fire ſhall try every mans work of what ſort it is, if any mans work abide which he hath built thereon, he ſhall receive a reward; but if any mans work ſhall be burnt, he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive loſs, yet he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. 22.</hi> I now come to ſpeak of the Snuffers which did belong to the Lamps in the Tabernacle.</head>
               <p>ANd there were Snuffers likewiſe made of pure gold, which belonged to the Tabernacle, as well as the Lamps and Candleſtick, <hi>Exod</hi> 37. 23.</p>
               <p>Now the uſe of that inſtrument; you know it is to correct, or to remove out of the way any thing that ſhall offend the burning of the light, that ſo the light might ſhine with the more brightneſs, and clearneſs: Now if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the thing, the ſnuffers are put together with the lamps, <hi>Exod. 37. 23. And he made ſeven lamps, and his ſnuffers, with his diſhes of pure gold;</hi> which gives us to underſtand, that the ſnuffers were appointed for the uſe of the Lamps; which Lamps, as I have ſaid, ſignifies the light of truth (which through the pourings out of the gifts of the Spirit, into the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93772:70"/> hearts of the gifted men of the Candleſtick, the Church) God intends by them to keep up in all ages of the world. Now by the adding the ſnuffers to the ſeven Lamps, we the better come to underſtand their property, which is as I have ſaid, to correct all thoſe ſuperfluities, which in cleaving to the lights of the Lamps are apt to hinder its ſhining.</p>
               <p>This ſhews us the great care which God doth and will take to the keeping up of the purity of truth, in its glory and luſtre in the Church, do what men and devils will to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: it ſhews us likewiſe the great proviſion which God hath prepared to his peoples hands, for the removing out of the way any thing that might tend to the darkening or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the light from burning in his Churches, and that is it which we are to underſtand by the Snuffers which were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Lamps.</p>
               <p>Now here two things are to be noted.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What it is which hinders the light of truth from ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Seeondly, What that proviſion is (which as the Snuffers) is given forth by God on purpoſe to correct it, and remove it out of the way.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, what it is which offends the light of truth in the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Its all that corrupt doctrine, and unſound opinions which falſe teachers labour to uſher into the Church of God and of Chriſt, by the cunning craftineſs of men, which han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the word of God deceitfully: of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in his time, who laboured to bring in damnable errours into the Church of God, <hi>Jude 4. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained unto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ungodly men, turning the grace of God into wantonneſs, and denying the onely Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> gives ſuch a charge to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus, Acts 20. 28, 29, 30.

And the fifth Angel ſounded, and I ſaw a ſtar fall from heaven unto the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomleſs pit, and he opened the bottomleſs pit, and there aroſe aſ make out of the bottomleſs pit like the ſmoke of a furnace, and the Sun and the Air was darkned by reaſon of the ſmoke of the pit.</hi> By the Sun and the Air here ſpoken of, I underſtand the Lamp light of truth, which did once burn in the Romiſh Church before its falling away, for it is the condition of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which the holy ſpirit intends in this Chapter, who intimates to you that as ſmoke darkens the Air, as that you cannot ſee the Sun in the Heavens, ſo this ſmoke of Errour and Antichriſtianiſm which aroſe from Hell, did wholly put out the Lamp lights of truth amongſt them, every where through out the Romiſh Church, ſo that this is one way of offending the light in the Churches of Chriſt, which hinders it from ſhining forth for the profit of others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A thing that hinders the light in ſhining, is the corruptneſs of the Teachers hearts, men that are ambitious of honour, or are covetous of gain being greedy after much of this world; theſe are ſuch as prove offenſive to the light of truth and very much hinder the ſhinings of it in the Church, ſuch were the Sons of old <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt, whoſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, greedy, covetous converſation made the ſacrifices of the

Likewiſe <hi>Jude</hi> tells you of a ſort of greedy Teachers, who run greedily after the way of <hi>Balaam</hi> for reward, and periſhed in the gainſaying of <hi>Corah,</hi> you ſee the Apoſtle makes the covetouſneſs of <hi>Balaam</hi> and the gainſaying of <hi>Corah</hi> to link together, and well he may, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one is ſuch a notable Introduction into the other ſin; for a man to grow greedy of gain with <hi>Balaam,</hi> is the ready way for him to become the truths gainſayer with <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> Now by ſuch things as theſe is the light of Gods pure work oftentimes darkned in the Church.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, what theſe ſnuffers are, or what that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is which God hath provided to correct theſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in order to the keeping pure the light of truth in the Churches of Chriſt, and this conſiſts of three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sound Arguments preached and preſt upon the Conſciences of men from the word of God, convincing men of the errour of their notions, who ſhall endeavour to vent any thing of an unſound or hurtful concernment in the Church of Chriſt, by holding forth to them the judgments of God, as they are laid down in his word againſt ſuch as ſhall perſiſt and go on in their obſtinacy: hence you have theſe words from S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus, Tit. 1. 9. Holding faſt the faithful word as have been taught, that he may be able by ſound Doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainſaver.</hi> You may adde unto this of <hi>Titus,</hi> the whole Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> which may very well be compared for its uſefulneſs this way, which (to me) doth wonderfully agree with the end of the ſnuffers of gold in the Tabernacle, which was made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Lamp light while ſhining in the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That means which in a ſecond place is to be added to the former, in order to the making up the ſnuffers in the Tabernacle of Gods Church, is a faithful admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the erroneous perſon for his errours and miſtakes,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93772:71"/> not favouring of him either for his place or greatneſs, you are to know truth is the greateſt of all, he is not worthy to be a profeſſour of truth, much leſs a Preacher of truth, who regards not truth above the perſon of any man in the world, this is the rule, 2 <hi>Theſ. 3. 14, 15 If any man obey not our word by this Epiſtle, note that man and have no company with him that he may be aſhamed;</hi> that is, be not ſo intimate with him as you are, and ought to be with thoſe that are ſound Chriſtians, that he may underſtand by your carriage that he is not right in the faith of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Yet count him not as an enemy, but admoniſh him as a friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third and laſt thing to be added to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the ſnuffers in the Goſpel tabernacle is this, that if nothing of the above ſaid means will prevail to the correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of errour in the maintainers thereof, then caſt him out for a Heretick, that he may do no more miſchief in the Church of Chriſt, giving notice to all the Churches what hath been done to ſuch a one, that the Churches may avoid and ſhun him where ever they meet with him; therefore is this rule given the Saints, <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A man that is a heretick after the firſt and ſecond admonition reject.</hi> Were this rule carefully obſerved in the Churches of Chriſt, how wonderfully would it conduce to the keeping truth free from thoſe mixtures of errour, which otherwiſe will cleave to it, do men what they can.</p>

                  <p>My dear Friends, let not Gods ancient contrivements from eternity go void of its great obſervations amongſt us; O peep a little into theſe great Miſteries of the Tabernacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip,

                  <p>O what cauſe have Chriſtians to adore the wiſdom of God, in framing together ſo glorious a piece as the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, with the ſeveral veſſels of it, as that there was not a veſſel in the whole Tabernacle without its ſpecial ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Heb. 10. 1.

                  <hi>CHAP 23.</hi> I now come to ſpeak of the two Altars which were made and placed in the Tabernacle, both of which having ſpecial reference to Jeſus Christ.</head>
               <p>THeſe Altars were two in number, their difference in form and faſhion was not great, only the one was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaid with pure gold and had his Crown upon it, and the other was overlaid with braſs, but we find not any Crown upon that, and the Altar which was overlaid with braſs had a Grate of Net-wort made for it, which was to let out the aſhes of the ſlain ſacrifices which were to be offered as a burnt-offering upon it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Both of the Altars had horns alike, which were in number four, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the four corners of the Altars, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 2. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 37. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Now theſe two Altars differed moſtly in uſe or office, for the Altar which was overlaid with pure gold and had the Crown upon it, was only to offer the burnt Incenſe upon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 26, 27. And the Altar which was overlaid with braſs, that only was to offer the burnt ſacrifice upon, which ſacrifices conſiſted of the bodies of the ſlain beaſts, which were to be offered before the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40 29.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Altars did ſignifie both to them and all elſe, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as then to come, with reſpect to the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold work which he was to do and ſuffer for believers; in the handling of which I ſhall do theſe two things</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you that theſe Altars did ſignifie Chriſt our Lord who was then to come.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:93772:73"/>
               <p>Secondly, That according to the differing uſes of theſe Altars, are the differing works of Chriſt for and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all true believers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That theſe Altars did ſignifie Chriſt to come, to this you have St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words agreeing, read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13, 14. In which place you have the Apoſtle ſpeaking how much a duty it is that Preachers of the Goſpel ſhould be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the Saints, and that becauſe they wait on the things of the Goſpel, and that was to preach and make known Jeſus Chriſt to their ſouls; now to prove that ſuch Miniſters are of right to be provided for, the Apoſtle doth inſtance the right which the Moſeical Law did give thoſe men (which did wait on the Altar) to eat of the things of the Altar, as if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, certainly Goſpel Miniſters have no leſs a right to a maintenance, then the legal Miniſters had under the Law, ſeeing our work is one and the ſame, the difference only lay in mode and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not in ſubſtance, they and we all taught one and the ſelf ſame Chriſt; they waited on the Altar typical, and we wait upon the Altar ſubſtantial; they upon the Altar of the legal tabernacle and we upon the Altar Chriſt of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly tabernacle, as that their Altar was but the type or forerunner of Chriſt our Evangelical Altar, which we wait on and preach to you; my end in this Commentary was not ſo much to handle a Miniſters maintenance, as to give you by what hath been ſpoken a ſight of the great congruity the Apoſtle makes to be between the Altars in the tabernacle and Chriſt Jeſus, ſo <hi>Heb. 13. 10. We have an Altar whereof none have right to eat which ſerve the tabernacle,</hi> you may eaſily perceive in reading through this Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> that the drift and purpoſe of the Apoſtle was to bring off the Jews from their reſting in theſe ſhadows, to live more upon Chriſt the true ſubſtance, which the legal Figures were only the types of; And labours to convince them that the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle with all the glorious Veſſels in it, together with what elſe was of any Ceremonial uſe amongſt them, all was but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93772:74"/> to ſhadow out Chriſt to come, read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And amongſt which things the Altars in the Tabernacle were of ſpecial uſe (in point of ſignification as they related to Chriſt) as any other type which was in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; And therefore doth the Apoſtle ſo apply the matter in hand, if you compare the 10. verſe of <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. with the 5th ver. of the ſame Chapter, for when in the 10. ver. he had ſpoken of the Jewiſh Altar, ſaying, in theſe words, <hi>We have an Altar which none have right to eat, which ſerve at the tabernacle,</hi> he preſently (in ver. 12.) brings in Chriſt as the Antytipe of that type in theſe words, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus that he might ſanctifie the people with his own bloud ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without the gate.</hi> Mark, he ſuffered without the gate as a ſacrifice which was proper to the Altar in the Tabernacle; thus you ſee how the Apoſtle makes Chriſt and the Altar in the Tabernacle to agree here alſo, ſo <hi>Rev. 6. 9. I ſaw under the Altar the ſouls of them which were beheaded for the word of God and for the teſtimony of Jeſus which they hold:</hi> Which Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar we muſt underſtand to be meant of Jeſus Chriſt, which was ſlain for the ſins of the world, under which ſacrifice lieth murdered, of the ſlain Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp; Martyrs of Jeſus Chriſt, that have died for the word of God in all Ages of the world, for as Chriſt was ſacrificed for their ſins, ſo are the Saints willingly ſacrificed for his truths; and ſo Chriſt and the Saints are by <hi>John</hi> repreſented to our view in one ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring heap or body together, only Chriſt hath the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, he firſt, and they after, or Chriſt above and his people under the Altar Chriſt; ſo that by all hath been ſpoken it appears that the Altars in the Tabernacle did intend Chriſt which was then to come in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew you in the next place, how the two Altars (being of two differing uſes) did ſignifie the two great works which Chriſt was to perform to God for believers.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the Altar that was overlaid with Braſs. This Altar ſignified Chriſt in the work of making or giving ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God for ſin, for upon this Altar
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93772:74"/> in the Tabernacle were the bodies of thoſe beaſts offered which were ſlain for ſin, and they were offered to God in hot flaming fire, therefore called the burnt offering; ſo was Jeſus Chriſt an Altar to bear the indignation of God for the Elect upon Chriſts back (as upon the Altar) did ſtand both the ſins and the burning hot wrath of Gods juſtice together, which like mighty flaſhes of lightning came upon the ſoul of our dear and precious Saviour, which made the bloudy ſweats upon him in the Garden, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 44.

We all like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid the iniquities of us all upon him, he was oppreſſed, he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,</hi> ſo ver, 10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him and to put him to grief, when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> ſo ver. 12. <hi>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death, and was numbred with the tranſgreſsour, and did bear the ſins of many,</hi> ſo 1 Pet. 1 18, 19. with chap. 2. 24. <hi>For ye know that ye were not redeemed with Silver or Gold, but by the precious bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, as a Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot, who in his own body bear our ſins upon the Tree.</hi> But notable is that place of the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb. 13. 11, 12. For the bodiess of thoſe beaſts, whoſe bloud is brought into the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary by the High Prieſt for ſin, are burnt without the Camp, wherefore Jeſus alſo that he might ſanctifie the people with his own bloud ſuffered without the gate,</hi> ſo Eph. 5. 2. ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>He gave himſelf for us an offering, and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour;</hi> Thus you ſee how Chriſt in his ſufferings makes good what the Altar of Braſs (with the ſacrifice upon it) did ſignifie and hold out to the beholders, where indeed our Saviour was both the Altar and the Sacrifice too: By which offering up of himſelf (as the Altar and Sacrifice to God) he hath purchaſed eternal Redemption for us, and hath for ever perfected thoſe which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93772:75"/> are ſanctified, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10, 12, 14. verſes.</p>

                  <p>Let this teach Chriſtians to have great recourſe to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of attonement and ſatisfaction. There be three ſeaſons when a Chriſtian ſhould have ſpecial regard to the Altar of ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In guilt ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In doubting ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In corruption-prevailing ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In guilty ſeaſons, when the heart and conſcience comes to be ſtained with the guilt of ſin, then is it the ſouls time to run to the Altar of ſatisfaction; when ever the Jews had any guilt broke out upon them; they were to take ſome offering or other in their hands, and a way to the Prieſt with it, that he might haſten to the altar of ſatisfaction, and there make an attonement for them by offering up their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering before the Lord. O ſo ſhould believers do when guilt breaks forth upon them, they ſhould flie by faith to their Goſpel Altar of ſatisfaction and attonement: ſaith <hi>John 1. 2. 1. 2. My little children, if any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, for he is a propitiation in his blood for our ſins, and not onely for ours, but for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> Certainly, many a poor ſoul many times lies longer under trouble of ſpirit then they need to do, were they but well acquainted with this truth, that the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. A through acquaintance with, and a cloſe application made of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in doubting times, it would wonderfully eaſe the heart in trouble; therefore, O troubled ſoul, wouldſt thou have thy guilts removed from thy conſcience, and wouldſt thou get thy ſelf into the favour of God again; wouldſt thou
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93772:76"/> have within in thy ſoul, wouldſt thou have the anger of God pacified again, whom thou haſt offended. O then, run to the altar of ſatisfaction, take an offering in thy hand, go and call upon the Prieſt, and pray him to go into the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle for thee, and there offer upon the Altar of ſatisfaction thy offering before the Lord; I mean take with thee in thy hand of faith, the blood, merits, and righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and beg him to lay up this upon the Altar of his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for thee. O ſtand at the Tabernacle door of the throne of grace, there call upon thy high Prieſt Jeſus, give him no reſt day or night, until he hath gone in to the Father, and made an attonement for thee: which done, thon mayeſt aſſure thy ſelf of that peace of God which paſſeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as the Jews in offering what they had to preſent their High Prieſt withal, might expect a full peace between God and their ſouls, which was obtained by the high Prieſt for them: And you know the obtaining of their peace at Gods hands upon their obſerving of this rule, was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable) ſo ſoul in the obſervation of this rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy ſoul and Chriſt, thou needeſt doubt of the love and favour of God to thy ſoul no more then the Jews.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond ſeaſon when a Chriſtian ſhould have regard to the Altar of ſatisfaction, is in doubting ſeaſons, when the Devil ſhall ſo far prevail, as to diſcourage the ſoul from coming to partake of his right to the altar of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and this the Devil doth oftentimes, by telling the ſoul that the Altar was never ſet up, or prepared for ſuch a vile rebellious wretch as the ſinning ſoul hath been. And thus the ſoul being filled with diſcouragements, is oftentimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſwallowed up with exceeding grief and deſpair. But let me anſwer the devil in that ſoul: O Satan, thou haſt by thy cunning, ſubtle, crafty devices deceived many poor ſouls this way already, by which helliſh craft thou haſt held back many a thouſand poor ſouls from partaking of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93772:77"/> of their Altar Chriſt, bearing them in hand, that the Father looks for greater preparations of ſoul, and higher qualifications of heart and life (to fit the ſoul for ſuch a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as the Altar Chriſt is) then the ſoul is yet able to bring with him, which deſign is but to put the ſoul upon delayes, on purpoſe for his everlaſting undoing, (for he well knows, if the ſoul ſhould ſtay from Chriſt until he be fit for Chriſt, the ſoul never gets Chriſt to eternity:) But Satan, that thou mayeſt prevail no more this way upon poor ſouls, I tell thee by the word of the Lord, and in the name of my God, firſt of all, that the Altar of ſatisfaction is erected and ſet up for every comer to it; as that, let the ſoul be never ſo vile, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, unclean, or impure in himſelf, yet he ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as heartily as ever was Saint in the world, if he will but come to the Altar; for Satan, thou knoweſt very well, (though thou thus blindeſt the eyes of poor ſouls) that the Commiſſion which Chriſt hath given to all his Miniſters, is to preach another doctrine in the world, then what thoa preacheſt to men and women, which is as follows, <hi>Iſaiah 55. 1, 2. Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and ye that have no money come ye buy wine and milk without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and without price: wherefore do you ſpend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not, hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your ſoul delight its ſelf in fatneſs: Incline your ear and come unto me, hear and your ſoul ſhall live; come unto me and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even ths ſure mercies of David:</hi> ſo <hi>John 7. 37. And Jeſus stood and cried, it any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink.</hi> Matthew 11. 28, 29. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and ye ſhall finde reſt to your ſouls; take my yoke upon you; for my yoke is eaſie, and my burden is light:</hi> So <hi>Revelations 22. 17. The Spirit ſaith come, and the Bride ſaith, come, and let him that heareth ſay, come, and let him that is a thirſt come, and whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely;</hi> ſo that the ſouls coming in a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93772:77"/> way of believing gives him a real right to the Altar of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; for the altar of ſatisfaction or attonement was erected for the guilty, not for the righteous: ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I come not to call the righteous but ſinners to repentance.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle tells you, that the Altar was ſet up to make reconciliation for ſinnes, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9. 13. But to perſwade a ſoul that he muſt not come to the Altar, until he is ſo and ſo qualified, and humbled, and mortified to ſinne, is to make void the great excellency of the Altar, and to render it of no effect.</p>
                  <p>Thus Satan, thou laboureſt by thy ſubtleties, not onely to deſtroy the ſoul for ever, by keeping it from Chriſt, but alſo thy next deſign is wholly to overthrow the glory of Chriſts ſufferings in the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Altar is ſo far from expecting ſuch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in the comers to it, as that it ſtands there on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give out theſe things to the comers: read <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 3. 33, 34. with <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 26. 27. Read <hi>Proverbs 1. 22. 23. How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity, and ſcorners delight in ſcorning, and fools ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e knowledge; turn ye at my reproofs: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will pour out my ſpirit upon you, and I will make known my words unto you.</hi> Therefore ſoul, let not the father of lyes keep thee any longer from Jeſus Chriſt thy Goſpel Altar, but come with the greateſt freedom, and do not diſpute ſo much thy unworthineſs, as the Lord Chtiſts ſufficiency in point of righteouſneſs; for whatever thy life hath been, though never ſo notoriouſly wicked, yet in the name of God, and by ſpecial commiſſion from Chriſt, we are to tell thee, that neither the number of thy ſins, nor yet the greatneſs of thy ſinnes can hurt thee, but thy coming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o the Altar of ſatisfaction. where attonement is to be made for ſinne: this is it that will prove thy ſoul-deſtroying ſinne for ever, if thou take not heed of it: Hence it is that <hi>David</hi> made the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93772:78"/> of ſin the onely ground of coming to the Altar, <hi>Pſal. 25. 11. Lord pardon my Iniquity, for my ſinne is wondrous great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A third ſeaſon when a Chriſtian ſhould have regard to the Altar of ſatisfaction is in corruption-prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſons, when the heart is overcome with the ſtrength of corruption, then is it a fit time for the ſoul to have much recourſe to ths Altar, corruption can never live if thou bring it to this place, that altar upon which Chriſt died for ſin will of all places in the world yield thee the greateſt death to, ſin this is the ſword of <hi>Goliah</hi> which hath none like it, <hi>Rom. 6. 6. Knowing this that our old man is Crucified, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> But worthy of note is that place of the Apoſtle in the 1 <hi>John 3. 8. For this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſt, that he might deſtroy the work of the Devil.</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, for this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, or for this purpoſe was the Altar of ſatisfaction erected and ſet up, that poor ſouls might as well get ſin and corruption mortified and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued in them, as to have the guilt of ſin removed out of their ſouls; O this is the tree of Life which ſtandeth in the Paradiſe of God, the leaves whereof will heal the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>O therefore ſoul wouldſt get down the power of ſin in thy ſoul, as well as to get out the guilt of ſin from thy ſoul; O then when ever corruption gets head, be ſure to bring thy ſoul to the Altar of ſatisfaction and atonement, and there lay thy ſoul down at the feet of the Altar, and beg of Jeſus Chriſt that he would yield forth the bleſſed effects of his death upon thy ſoul, that as he died upon the Croſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of the way the guilt of thy ſins, ſo likewiſe he would be pleaſed (out of his infinite mercy and love) to drop ſomething of his ſufferings, ſome vertue of his death into thy ſoul, which might kill ſin in thy mortal body: Now this being done, adding faith to the work, thou needſt not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93772:78"/> doubt but a bleſſed iſſue in time will proceed to the great joy and comfort of thy ſoul, only labour for a waiting frame of ſpirit, give God his own time to effect this work in thy ſoul, for in time thou ſhalt Reap if thou faint not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection,</hi> But doth not the Apoſtle ſay in <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 13. 10. That we have an Altar whereof they have no right to eat which ſerve the Tabernacle, then it ſeems all may not come with that boldneſſe to the Altar of ſatisfaction as you ſay?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Apoſtle is not to be underſtood ſo much in treating about the guilt of ſin as above the uſe of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Now the dangerous condition of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> was two-fold, not only was their Caſe ſad with reſpect to their diſtance from God upou the account of ſinnes guilt,</p>
                  <p>But their danger did farther appear in this, they having their Ceremonies for a Chriſt to reſt upon, this kept them from Chriſt indeed, by which means they were deprived of the benefit of Chriſts Merits, Bloud, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which only takes away the guilt of ſin, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle elſewhere ſaith, <hi>Galatians 5 4. For Chriſt is become of none effect unto you, whoſoever of you are iuſtified by the Law you are faln from grace:</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo long as you ſtick to your Ceremonies and Jewiſh Rights, you are at a great diſtance with Chriſt, Chriſt can profit you nothing, for you have Converted the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle Service into a Chriſt, and you reſt here, and you live upon the Shadow in the neglect of the true Subſtance Chriſt, unto which theſe Types and Legal Shadows ſhould lead you.</p>
                  <p>Therefore while you ſerve the Tabernacle (in this ſenſe) you have no right to eat of the Altar Chriſt, but otherwiſe, let the ſouls condition be never ſo deſperate by reaſon of ſinne, yet here is an open door for him to ſtep into the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93772:79"/> Tabernacle, and fall upon this Altar Chriſt with boldneſſe, according to that word of the Apoſtle in <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 9, 13, 14, 14.</p>
                  <p>So that there is no ſinne how great ſoever makes the ſoul uncapable of partaking of the Altar Chriſt, (who hath a deſire to make out after Chriſt) but only the ſouls reſting upon ſome thing elſe on this ſide Chriſt, and ſhall make that and not Chriſt his bottom for Salvation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 24</hi> Of the Grate of Network made to this Altar.</head>
               <p>I Now come to ſpeak about the Grate of Network, which was made to the Altar, and placed under the compaſs of the Altar; which was about the midſt of the Altar, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>The uſe of which was to let forth the Aſhes through the ſmall holes of the Grate, when the Sacrifice or Burnt Offering ſhould be offered before the Lord upon it.</p>
               <p>Now the Aſhes of any thing which is burnt, we look on it as the Droſs or Excrements of the thing burned; ſo it is in this caſe: therefore was the Grate prepared to convey the Aſhes of the ſacrifice under the Altar, which was to be carried forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Camp. This ſhews us this much: Firſt of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich uſefulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt every way for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In point of Juſtification:</p>
               <p>From hence Believers may aſſure themſelves, that when Chriſt became a Sacrifice to God for them (in order to their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification) that God was well pleaſed with it, which was for the great comfort of Believers, publickly witneſſed from Heaven, <hi>Mat. 3. 17. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> To this agreeth the words of S. <hi>Paul, Epheſ. 5. 2. Chriſt gave himſelf for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much as this you may read in this bleſſed Type, for there was nothing which was offered upon this Altar to God, but was pure; I mean that of the Sacrifice which aſcended up to God, that was very pure; for the Aſhes which was the Droſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of the Sacrifice, that was conveyed away through the Grate of Net-work, which was made and placed under the Altar for that purpoſe: I ſay this ſhould exceedingly comfort Believers, with reference to the foundation of their Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; their Altar-Sacrifice was a Sacrifice full of purity, without
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93772:81"/> the leaſt ſpot or ſtain in it; an offering without blemiſh to God, yea a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe.</head>
                  <p>This informs us then of the ſad condition of two ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt us. Firſt, thoſe that dare offer God with any other offering then Chriſt for their Juſtification, or ſhal offer any thing to God in any other name, then in Chriſts name: know you that the beſt Sacrifices which you can offer God of your own, or in your own names, or in the names of any Saint or Angel, hath too much of their Aſhes and Droſs in them, then to have any acceptance with God, you have no Grate made of Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work to ſever the Aſhes from your Sacrifices: What ever a ſoul ſhall offer God in ſacrifice, if it doth carry the leaſt impurity or droſs in it, it will be ſo far from juſtifying of you before God, as that it will but ſink you deeper and deeper into hell, <hi>Gal</hi> 3. 10. O therefore be not deceived any longer ye ſelf-righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in thinking that your duties, and works of Righteouſneſs will bear you out before God! no, no, there is no man is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſight of God by the deeds of the Law, ſaith <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3. 11. the reaſon is given you by the Church, in <hi>Iſaiah 64. 6. For we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſses are as filthy rags.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It informs us of the ſad condition of thoſe which were once enlightned into the excellency of this Altar-Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as that they wholly lived upon him for life, and would onely fetch in their peace and comfort and refreſhment this way; and in this light they rejoyced for a ſeaſon, but are now gone back again, and have left their Altar-Sacrifice, and will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer God their own duties and works of righteouſneſs, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Aſhes of impurity. Oh! the condition of theſe men and women is worſe then the former; becauſe theſe are fallen from Grace it ſelf: And therefore although they may talk much of Chriſt within them, yet Chriſt ſhall profit them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4. But I ſhall refer theſe back-ſliding ſouls to read that dreadful place in <hi>Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightned, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93772:81"/> were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they ſhall fall away to renew them again to repentance; ſeeing they have crucified to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and have put him to open ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And more principally, the Grate of Net-work in the Altar, through which the Aſhes of the Sacrifice was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it may allude to the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, which is to preſent for us our Sacrifice to God as a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, for that is the proper work of Jeſus Chriſt as a High Prieſt, to and for his people, who ſtands at the Altar on purpoſe to ſever the Aſhes from the imperfect duties, which his people do offer up to God: for as the Grate of Net-work in the Altar did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Aſhes from the Sacrifice which was offered upon it, ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt convey away out of ſight all the weakneſſes and infirmities of the Saints duties which aſcend up to God; therefore in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 3. it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>That he ſhall ſit as a refiner and purifier of ſilver, and he ſhall purifie the Sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and ſilver that they might offer to God an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in righteouſneſs.</hi> So that you ſee it is Chriſts work to ſever the droſs from the pure metal, both as to the perſons of his people and their performances; that ſo their duties might ſmell pleaſant in the noſtrills of God. Chriſt is the Altar, with the Grate of Net-work in it, that caſteth away (through himſelf) all the pollutions of our duties: therefore the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. having ſpoken of the Altar Chriſt under the Levitical type, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. tells you in the 12. <hi>ver. Wherefore Jeſus, alſo that he might ſanctifie they people ſuffered without the Gate.</hi> That is, Chriſt as the Altar did both ſanctifie the perſons and the duties of his people, that their ſacrifices as well as their perſons might be a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> This ſhould teach believers where to bring their duties in the worſhip and ſervice of God, that they might be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God. O ſoul! wouldſt thou have thy prayers, thy praiſes, thy duties, thy ſervices, all accepted with God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? O then direct them all to this ſpiritual Altar Chriſt. There is the Grate of Net-work in Chriſt, that will carry away, and convey out of ſight all thy defilements, impurities, weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93772:82"/> and infirmities of thy duties, which would have diſpleaſed God greatly, for God is a God of purer eyes then to behold the leaſt ſin: therefore when ever thou haſt any thing to do with God in the duties of his Worſhip, be ſure to eye Jeſus Chriſt: O beg of him that he would perform the office of the Altar (with the Grate of Net-work in it) for the wellfare of thy ſoul. Deſire him to ſever the aſhes of thy duties from thy, duties, and that he would ſhake out the ignorance of thy duties from thy duties, together with the unbelief, Hypocriſie, Pride, Deadneſs, Drowſineſs, and backwardneſs of Spirit; beſides that formality, ſpiritual Pride, and wandring Thoughts, which cleaves ſo faſt to duty, as the fleſh cleaves to the bones: but poſſibly many a poor ſoul may not be acquainted with their danger in miſcarrying in duty as it were to be wiſhed they were. Take a Scripture or two, <hi>Malachy 1. 13, 14. Ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the ſick; thus ye brought an offering, ſhould I accept this at your hands, ſaith the Lord; but curſed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth unto the Lord a corrupt thing; for I am a great King, ſaith the Lord of Hoſt, and my name is great amongſt the Heathen:</hi> So <hi>Jer. 48. 10. Curſed be the man that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully.</hi> By which we may underſtand theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that its very poſſible that men and women may deeply miſcarry in their duties towards God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That ſo to do is a very dangerous thing. O then if corrupt things may be offered to God in Worſhip, and ſo to do is ſo dangerous, as appears by theſe Scriptures before alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; O then what infinite reaſon is there, that all Believers ſhould make conſtant uſe of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Saints Goſpel Altar, as not daring to offer up any thing to God in his Worſhip, but upon this Altar, where the Grate of Net-work is, where they may be ſure there ſhall nothing paſs up to God, but what is pure and acceptable.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. 23.</hi> I come now to ſpeak of the Horns of this Altar.</head>
               <p>THis Altar had four Horns, and they were placed upon the four corners of it.</p>
               <p>The uſe and purpoſe of the horns upon the Altar I finde to be two-fold. Firſt, they were appointed and ſet up to binde the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to them, that ſo the ſacrifice (being kept equally ſtrait by the cords which came from the four corners of the Altar) might not ſtart aſide, as otherwiſe it might have done: there is ſo much as this to be gathered out of the words of <hi>David, Pſalm 118. 27. God is the Lord who hath ſhewed us light, binde the ſacrifice with cords, even to the Horns of the Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is very likely that theſe Horns of the Altar might be a kinde of refuge to the Hebrews, as their cities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge were, performing ſomething of the ſame uſe to malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, as the Cities of refuge did which we read of in <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. with <hi>Joſhua</hi> 20. 2.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to be the uſe of the Horns of the Altar, if we conſider that place in 1 <hi>King:</hi> 2. 28. with verſe 30. when <hi>Joab</hi> had fled to the Horns of the Altar, about his rebelling againſt King <hi>Solomon;</hi> the King ſends forth his Executioner to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; but when the Executioner came and found him hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Horns of the Altar, he went back again to the King to report the matter, and to know his farther pleaſure therein; which ſtrongly intimates to us, that theſe Altar Horns did afford men, in that kinde of diſtreſs, ſome ſuccour and relief againſt preſent Execution. Both of which uſes of the Horns of the Altar leads us to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for ſomething (as our great treaſury) which may be fetched out of him, both for our inſtruction and comfort.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:93772:83"/>
               <p>Firſt of all for our inſtruction it ſhews us thus much, That as the Jewiſh Sacrifices were tied with cords to the Horns of the Altar, ſo ſhould Believers (if they would not have their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Duties miſcarry) binde them faſt with ſpiritual cords to the Horns of their Altar Chriſt. There be five cords which I ſhall preſent you with, as very neceſſary to the binding of all our duties to the Horns of our ſpiritual Altar Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the cord of believing; this is ſo neceſſary a cord, that if our duties be not bound faſt to the Horns of the Altar Chriſt with it, all our labour will be loſt labour, do what we can, <hi>Heb. 11. 6. For without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; for he that cometh to God, muſt believe that God is, and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them which diligently ſeek him.</hi> So verſe 4. its ſaid, <hi>By faith Abel offered a more acceptable ſacrifice then Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here let me admoniſh two ſorts of perſons: Firſt, ſuch as yet have no Faith at all. O Sirs, what do you mean, that you can content your ſelves to live all this while in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith? Oh! how do you mean to have your duties acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted with God in Heaven, when you want Faith? Unbelievers are ſo far from pleaſing God, as that he hates all they do as an abominable filthy thing, and all for want of Faith, which is the Cord that ſhould binde your Sacrifices to Chriſt; for whoſe ſake any thing is valued that is offered up to God: You ſee <hi>Cain</hi> offered his Sacrifice to God as well as <hi>Abel,</hi> yet God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded onely <hi>Abels.</hi> O friends, you may ſee what reſpects God hath for your Services while you remain in a ſtate of unbelief: Read <hi>Iſa. 66. 3. He that killeth an Oxe, is as if he ſlew a man; he that ſacrificeth a Sheep is as if he cut off a Dogs neck; he that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth an oblation, as if he offered ſwines blood, he that offereth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe as if he had bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſsed an Idol: yea they have choſen their own wayes, and their ſouls delight in their abominations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O poor ſouls, how are you deluded by Satan, who ſpurs you on in the ways of wickedneſs and unbelief, keeping you all the while in darkneſs and ignorance as to the grace of believing, which is the main neceſſary Cord that ſhould binde your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Horns of the Altar Chriſt; as that if it be wanting, all that you do is but as the howling of dogs in the ears of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93772:83"/> Lord, as the Prophet ſpeaks: O therefore you that are Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, leave off your ſins, and turn to God: Oh go and beg of God for true ſaving juſtifying faith in Chriſt Jeſus; that ſo you may be accepted in your perſons, and then God will accept of your performances: for God muſt firſt like your perſons, before he can have any regard to your performances; and your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cannot be accepted, until you are found in Chriſt: and you cannot be found in Chriſt until you have faith to put you into him; and then when God (through believing in Chriſt) accepts of your perſons: then will he like of your duties, and not before then.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This ſerves for inſtruction, touching thoſe which have Faith, but are not ſo careful in the uſe and exerciſe of it, as they ſhould be in their duties of Worſhip towards God. O be admoniſhed, in and about all you do in the Worſhip of God, to ſet Faith on work. O remember, that under the Law, the Sacrifice was to be tied faſt to the Horns of the Altar: O labour in the diſcharge of duty, to get up the cord of Faith in your hands, and binde your duties faſt to Jeſus Chriſt: O look up by an eye of believing to Chriſt, when you pray, read, hear the word, ot break bread, or what ever you do elſe, hang up all upon this Altar, and binde it faſt to the Horns of it by this Cord of believing, by concluding (when you come off from the work) that God will hear your Prayers for his Sons ſake; and upon this account he will accept your duties, though weak and poor, and that he will in his time feed you and ſatisfie you, and give you the thing you have asked at his hands for his own name ſake; becauſe you have builded upon the Lord Jeſus his worthineſs, and have tied your duties faſt about him; for Faith is the uniting grace between Chriſt and Believers; it firſt ties our ſouls to Chriſt, and next our duties; therefore ſaith <hi>Habakuck, 2. 4. The juſt man ſhall live by his faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Cord with which Believers ſhould and ought to binde faſt their ſacrifices to the Horns of this Altar Chriſt, is a ſound underſtanding; in and about the things they offer to God in ſacrifice; for want of which, Believers do loſe very much of the reward of their work with God. Under the Law,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93772:84"/> if thoſe ſacrifices which the Jews did offer to God had wanted but an eye, it was rejected, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 22. The eye you know is the diſcerning part of a Beaſt; and ſurely God hath no more regard for an eye-leſs ſacrifice under the Goſpel, then he had under the Law; for if knowledge (which is the eye of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice) be wanting, it is an imperfect ſacrifice, and much ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed in Gods account: therefore ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Cor. 14. 15. What is it then, when I pray, I will pray with the ſpirit and with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and when I ſing, I will ſing with the ſpirit, and with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:</hi> ſo that you ſee, S. <hi>Paul</hi> was very careful to binde (what ſacrifice he had to offer God withall) very faſt to the Horns of the Altar Chriſt, with this cord of underſtanding; and indeed ſo ſhould all Believers elſe labour for ſuch a meaſure of knowledge, and ſpiritual underſtanding of, and diſcerning into the things of God, ſo as to acquaint themſelves with the nature, uſe, end, vertue, and excellency of the work and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, in which they are imployed, as that they may be able to give God a reaſon of what they do: as that when God ſhall ask them this queſtion (in their conſciences) as once he did the Jews in <hi>Iſa. 1. 12. Who hath required this at your hands.</hi> They may be able to anſwer again with the Church, in <hi>Iſa 26. 13. O Lord our God, other Lords beſides thee have had dominion over us, but by thee onely will we make men ion of thy name.</hi> You know how God diſregarded the Corinthians duties, and ſacrifices, for want of a true diſcerning of the things in Worſhip which they adventured upon, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 29, 30. Therefore my Brethren, take S. Peters advice, 2 Pet. 2 18. But grow in grace and knowledge,</hi> that through the exerciſe of which grace, you may ſo binde your duties to the horns of your Altar Chriſt, as that through the not ſtarting aſide of your ſacrifices, you may be ſure not to miſs of the reward of your work.</p>
               <p>3. A third cord with which believers ſhould bind their duties to the horns of their Goſpel-Altar Chriſt, is the cord of love and affection.</p>
               <p>Love is and ought to be the ſpring of action, it is not what ſervices we do for God, as the principle from whence they flow forth to God, is the thing God looks at; for did we offer God
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93772:84"/> (in one ſacrifice) the cattel upon a thouſand hills, yet if this comes not freely to God from a principle of love and affection, God hates all when done: notable is that place in the Pſalms, <hi>Pſal. 40. 6, 7, 8 ſacrifice and offerings thou didſt not deſire, mine ear haſt thou opened, burnt offerings and ſin offerings thou didſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, then I ſaid, lo I come as its written of me in the Volume of the Book, I delight to do thy will O God, yea thy Law is in my heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though this Propheſie do principally concern Chriſt, whoſe bloud was preferred before all the Sacrifices in the world with reſpect to the taking away of ſin, yet this Scripture may not be unfitly applyed to the Saints with reſpect to their right perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of duty, which teacheth us thus much; that unleſs that principle of delight or Law of love (here ſpoken of) be in the heart as a bottom to all our duties, all our Sacrifices are of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle value with God: therefore in <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 3. who ever they were that would offer any thing to God in Sacrifice, he was to offer it with a willing mind; the reaſon of it is given you by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 9. 7. For God loveth a chearful giver.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe.</head>
                  <p>O then my friends labour after this grace of the holy Spirit, O make it much of your buſineſs at the throne of grace, that God would ſhed abroad much of his Spirit and Grace of love upon your hearts, that ſo you might not miſcarry in your work and ſervice; and for want of this bleſſed cord to tie your ſervices faſt at the horns of the Altar Jeſus Chriſt: O this is a bleſſed grace of the Spirit of God, he that hath much of this in his heart is a rich man.</p>
                  <p>The world accounts thoſe rich that have much of the wealth of this world in their houſes, but the word accounts them rich which have much of this grace ſhed abroad in their hearts by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>This makes duty acceptable, this grace of love to God, (if in the heart) will make a little Goats hair that is offered to God, pleaſing and acceptable in Gods ſight. Read <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 23. and this will make thy weakeſt of groans very ſweet to God, O therefore forget not to labour after this precious grace and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93772:85"/> Jewel of the ſpirit of God, for the more you have of this to love God withall, the more God will love you, &amp; the more will God delight in your duties; love (as we uſe to ſay) is the loadſtone of love, it draws the heart of the object beloved to love again.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Cord with which Believers ſhould tie their duties to the Horns of the Altar Chriſt, is ſincerity and uprightneſs of heart in the things of God; ſincerity of heart to God is var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh to all our other gifts of the Spirit, therefore doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prefer this beyond the higheſt gifts and parts and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which men may be endowed with in this world, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 1, 2. Though I had the Tongues of men and Angels to ſpeak with all, yet if I had not Charity, I am become a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By the heart is meant the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs and ſincerity of the Soul, concerning thoſe things which the Soul ſhall ſet about for God; hence you have it in 1 <hi>Samuel 16. 7. The Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth, man looketh at the outward appearance, but God looketh at the heart.</hi>

               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe.</head>
                  <p>O labour for this cord of ſincerity, that you may find favour in the eyes of God, touching what you do in his Worſhip: O
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93772:85"/> this is as the Gold about the Temple, which made it ſo glorious to the beholders, ſo doth this grace wonderfully adorn the Temple of our Souls to God, in which God delights to dwell, therefore are the prayers of the upright ſo delightful to God; <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. Never think your duties faſt bound to the Altar Chriſt, unleſs they are tied to the Horns of it with this cord; O conſider well that place in the 1 <hi>Chron. 28. 9. Davids</hi> words to <hi>Solomon, and thou</hi> Solomon <hi>my Son, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind, for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all imaginations of the thoughts; if thou ſeek him he will be found of thee, but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Fifth cord with which Believers ſhould bind their duties to the Horns of the Altar Chriſt, is a zealous fervent Spirit in the work and Worſhip of God, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom. 12. 11. Not ſlothful in buſineſs, but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Soul that acts carleſly in the Worſhip of the Lord, is like a Cord let looſe or ſlackt, it gives liberty to the thing tied to role or ſtart at pleaſure: A careleſs heat in Worſhip deſtroys all in hand, and brings a Curſe upon the perſon found under ſo filthy a frame of Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Many Chriſtians inſenſibly periſh and die to their growth in Sanctification, and yet ignorant of the Reaſon of it; alas it lieth here (<hi>viz.</hi>) in their giving way too much to a careleſs frame of Spirit in the work of God, who can think or imagine that God will bleſs the means appointed for our growth in Sanctification, when we come to the means and Ordinances of the Goſpel, void of hearts and ſerious ſpirits, which ſhould fit them for the bleſſing of it, <hi>Luke 1153. The hungry are filled with good things, but the rich are ſent empty away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We uſe to ſay that Gold is better worth then to give to Children to play withall, ſo doth God account the precious things of the Spirit better worth then to give out to careleſs Children, who rather play with holy things then truly prize them; as it too too often appears by theſe two great evils.

O be afraid of this ye careleſs heedleſs, ſouls, which can pray, and read, and hear themſelves faſt aſleep in the Worſhip and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God; and others that can ſuffer their eyes and hearts
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93772:86"/> to wander after every vain object, while in the Worſhip of God; of ſuch a ſort of people did God complain of long ago; in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. God ſaith, <hi>This people draweth near me with their lips, and with their mouths they ſeem to honour me; but their hearts run after their covetouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I come now to ſpeak of the ſecond particular of the Horns on the Altar as they lead to Chriſt, and that is what affords the ſoul as much comfort, as the other did Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider the Protection Believers have by Chriſt (while in his Service and Worſhip) if they with <hi>Joab</hi> do fly to Chriſt the great Altar for it; It cannot be denied but that theſe ſouls (whoſe hearts God hath awakend, to behold their danger while in the Worſhip and Service of Chriſt) have great cauſe to dread and fear what may befall them, or become of them before they come off the duty; now that danger which attends the people of God while they are engaged in the work of God, may be three ways conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, With reſpect to the Juſtice of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, With reſpect to the Malice of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, With reſpect to the Malice and Hatred of wicked men here below.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, With reſpect to the Juſtice of God, which cannot bear with the leaſt ſin committed any where, much leſs in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice: As to that, did not the bloud and merits of Chriſt interpoſe between the juſtice of God and the ſoul, (in the performance of his duties) it were impoſſible that ever the ſoul ſhould come off alive again, becauſe of theſe ſtains, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, impurities, and defilements; our beſt of duties are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an inſtance, you may take for this in the two Sons of <hi>Aaron, Levit.</hi> 10. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is ſo if we conſider the Malice of the Devil, who like a Roaring Lion is going up and down the earth ſeeking whom he may devour; whoſe devouring Rage and Malice is moſtly bent againſt the ſoul, when the ſoul is engaged for God in the performance of ſome ſpiritual duty; a figure of which you may ſee in <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 1. where no ſooner was <hi>Joſhua</hi> the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93772:87"/> High Prieſt ingaged in the performance of the work of the Prieſthood, but preſently you have Satan at his right hand to reſiſt him; whoſe work was to hinder him in, and to unfit <hi>Joſhua</hi> for the work of God what he could, therefore ſaith S. <hi>Peter, 1 Pet. 5. 8. Be ſober, be vigilant, for your adverſary the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil like a roaring Lion goeth about ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Its ſo with reſpect to the Rage and Malice of wicked men, who out of an implacable hatred againſt the work of God, labour to take all occaſions that might be, to endeavour the utter ruine and deſtruction of the people of God; what tumults and commotion have the Children of this world (in all ages) raiſed up againſt the godly, for their zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous attending upon the pure Worſhip and ways of God? How many thouſands of Innocent ſouls have the ſeed of <hi>Cain</hi> brought down to the duſt, for their keeping cloſe to the ways and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God? And to this day how do the wicked plot againſt the juſt, ſeeking all occaſions againſt them, to bring them down to the duſt both as to Life and Eſtate? How often (in our days) have the wicked run together in whole heaps upon the godly to diſturb them, and to divide and confound them in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Worſhip of God? How have ſome with drawn Swords and cockt Piſtols violently broken into the Aſſembles of the Lords people on purpoſe to deſtroy them in the place? How have the ungodly in our days halled out ſome of their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and dragged forth others by the heels through the ſtreets of our Cities and Towns to Priſon, not ſparing any either for ſex or age? How full have the Priſons been at a time of the godly, meerly for their being found in the Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God? How have ſome been Sequeſtred from their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, others condemned to die in open Seſſions, meerly upon the account of their being found in the Worſhip and Service of God, together for their refuſing to comply with any other Worſhip elſe? Put all this together, and have not the godly cauſe to fear and dread when in the Worſhip of God? who are expoſed to all theſe dangers, to danger from Heaven, to danger from Hell, and the danger from this wicked world below. O then what cauſe is there for the people of God (when in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93772:87"/> Service and Worſhip of God) to have great recourſe to the Horns of the Altar Chriſt for ſafety with reſpect to ſoul and body; And with <hi>Joab</hi> to take hold of them and ſhelter there. O make much uſe of Chriſt for this end and purpoſe, for he is the Horns of the Altar that thou ſhouldeſt flie unto; for its Chriſt adminiſtreth ſafety to the ſoul, when in his work and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as well as procureth acceptation for thy work and ſervice to God; therefore when ever thou ſetteſt about Altar-work be ſure to take hold of the Altar Horns: Therefore ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſalm 96. 6. Honour and Majeſty are before him, Strength and Beauty are in his Sanctuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it was that <hi>David</hi> could ſo willingly Worſhip God, and deſired (ſo much) to be found in his ſervice, he knew that the Horns of the Altar Chriſt could afford him all manner of Protection, either againſt the Juſtice of God, the Malice of the Devil, or the Rage of the wicked and ungodly in this life, <hi>Pſal. 84. 10, 11. I had rather be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of God, then to dwell in the tents of wickedneſs, for the Lord is a ſun and a ſhield.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov. 18. 10. The name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous run there and are ſafe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O you ſee what Protection the Horns of this Altar Chriſt did afford the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at the Red Sea, and in the Wilderneſs all along to their <hi>Canaan;</hi> what a covering cloud was be to his people by day, and what a Pillar of fire was he to them by night, for the ſafety of all theſe (in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) which by faith took hold of him as their Horn of ſtrength and ſafety, inſomuch that the people never miſcarryed untill they let go their hold-faſt in him, as you may ſee in Pſalm 106. from 34. to the 42. Verſe.</p>
                  <p>O therefore ſoul, wouldeſt thou be preſerved from the ſtorm and blaſt of the terrible One, which beateth againſt the wall, which affrights thee in the Worſhip and Servive of God. O then when ever it be thou art about to Worſhip God either in publick or private, be ſure as ſoon as thou draweſt near to the Altar of Worſhip to take faſt hold of the Horns of it; I mean lay faſt hold by the hand of Faith of the promiſed ſtrength and Protection of Chriſt, and be ſure to hang there: O lift up thy
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93772:88"/> ſoul to him, and beg him that he would now hide thee from the Juſtice of God; that for the ſtains and infirmities and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thy duties are clothed with all, thou mighteſt eſcape the portion that <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> was once in the like caſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken withall, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 12. And beg of him that he would be a refuge for thee, againſt the Malice of the Devil, who will be at thy right hand to reſiſt thee, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 1. And that he would hide thee from the malice and fury of the wicked of the Earth, who are hunting up and down from place to place (like ſo many dogs) to find out ſuch as are attending the ſervice of God, That if poſſible they may undoe them, either in or for their work; this made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly intreat the Saints in his day, that they would pray that he might be delivered from unreaſonable men, <hi>For all men have not faith, 2 Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. So <hi>Epheſ. 6. 12. For we wrestle not against fleſh and bloud, bue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Principalities, againſt Powers, against the Rulers of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world, against ſpiritual wickedneſs got into high places.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. 24.</hi> I come to ſpeak of the Incenſe Altar over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with Gold, as it differed from the former which was overlaid with Braſs.</head>
               <p>THe uſe of the Incenſe Altar, was to offer Incenſe upon for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40, 26. 27. which Incenſe offered upon the Altar overlaid with Gold, did make the other offerings that were offered upon the Altar over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with Braſs ſo ſavory and ſweet before the Lord.</p>
               <p>This the Apoſtle applies to Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 2. In which words he takes in the uſe of both the Altars, and ſhews you that the Incenſe Altar overlaid with Gold was ſet up to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93772:88"/> make the ſacrifices of the ſlain beaſts (which were offered upon the Altar overlaid with Braſs) very ſweet and delightfull to God.</p>
               <p>Pray obſerve well, the words conſiſt of two parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of what relates to the Altar overlaid with Braſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What relates to the Altar overlaid with Gold, which was called the Incenſe Altar.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of what related to the Altar overlaid with Braſs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was offered the ſlain beaſts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 29. This is ſet forth to you in theſe words of <hi>Epheſ. 5. 2. Walk in love as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us an offering and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God:</hi> This part of the Verſe agrees with the Altar which was overlaid with Braſs, upon which the ſlain ſacrifices were offered up to God in ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which in the Verſe relates to the Incenſe Altar overlaid with Gold, you have in the latter part of the Verſe in theſe words, <hi>for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> Both of which Uſes of the Altars, the Apoſtle makes to agree to and in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt a Believers ſpiritual Altar.</p>
               <p>But here a queſtion may be asked me, why the Incenſe Altar ſhould be overlaid with Gold, and the Altar appointed for ſlain ſacrifices only with Braſs? To which I anſwer, by this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the two Altars, we may obſerve this note for our Inſtruction; That as Gold is more excellent then Braſs, ſo was the work of the Incenſe Altar more excellent in the ſight of God, then that work of ſlaying the ſacrifices on the Altar which was overlaid with Braſs: And as theſe Altars were both Types of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with reference to the twofold work he was to adminiſter for the Elect (which was firſt to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſacrifice, and ſecondly to make continual Interceſſion to God for them.) I ſay it plainly ſhews us thus much, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the work which our Saviour did in dying the bitter death on the Croſs, in order to the ſatisfying of the juſtice of God (wherein he was a ſacrifice to take away ſin.) I ſay though this was a very glorious and tranſcendent work, yet the work of Chriſts Interceſſion is much more glorious. This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we conſider theſe two things. Firſt, the Apoſtles words
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93772:89"/> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. who puts the term (Rather) upon the Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, (a work proper to the Incenſe Altar) which term is not put upon the ſufferings of Chriſt, Verſe 34 <hi>Who is he that ſhall condemn, it is Chriſt that died; yea rather is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God to make Interceſſion for us,</hi> giving you to underſtand that the greater excellency of the two lay in the work of Chriſts Interceſſion, rather then in the work of Chriſts ſufferings; farther, it will more appear in that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (in this 34. Verſe) tells you, that for this work ſake of Chriſts Interceſſion, he ſitteth at Gods right hand; as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, though the work of Chriſts ſufferings was a very glorious work, yet that of his Interceſſion was, yea is much more glorious in Gods ſight, becauſe the act of Chriſts Interceſſion declares the former act of his ſufferings to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done and compleated; therefore muſt Chriſt ſit down at his Fathers right hand: This you may farther ſee held out to you in the Type it ſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37. 26. where you may obſerve that the Incenſe Altar had his Crown of Gold placed upon it, (which the other Altar had not) which ſhews us (as hath been ſaid) that this work of Chriſts Interceſſion Crowns all the former.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly it will yet more appear, if we conſider the eſtate and condition our Saviour was in when ſuffering upon the Croſs, and that was a guilty ſtate and condition he was under, (at that time, when he was upon the Croſs) the higheſt guilt that ever was man in this world (not any of his own) for there was never guile found in his mouth, but it was our guilt which he took upon him, <hi>Iſa. 53. 6. For it pleaſed the Lord to lay upon him the iniquity of us all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the work of Interceſſion he is fully juſtified from all that ſin and guilt (which he took on him for us) by the offering up of himſelf to God as a ſacrifice, and the juſtice of God hath nothing now to ſay againſt Chriſt; ſo that Chriſt takes his place in Heaven (without controul or objection) at the right hand of God, who ſits there making Interceſſion for us: And Chriſt taking his place there at the Incenſe Altar, doth cauſe a ſweet ſmell to ariſe up to God from every other act of Chriſt done before upon the ſacrifice Altar overlaid with Braſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93772:89"/> now he acts not as a nocent perſon but as an innocent perſon, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8, 9. ſpeaking of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>And being found in faſhion like a man, he humbled himſelf and became obedient to dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h; even the death of the Croſs, wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name:</hi> Thus you ſee why the Altar of Incenſe was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with Gold, but the other only with Braſs.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe.</head>
                  <p>O then this ſhould teach Believers where to run for ſound ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid comfort in doubting ſeaſons, let it be at the Altar of Incenſe where Chriſt ſitteth at Gods right hand to make Interceſſion for us. Its true, I have in my former Diſcourſe about the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of ſatisfaction (which was overlaid with Braſs) adviſed ſouls to make at that Altar in doubting ſeaſons, and ſo I ſay ſtill; for Chriſt could not have ſate down at the right hand of God to have made Interceſſion for us, if he had not firſt ſuffered, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>But the ſufferings of Chriſt on the Altar of Braſs do not yield a ſoul ſuch full matter of triumph over Sin, the Law, and the Devil, as the interceeding work of Chriſt doth.</p>
                  <p>My Reaſon for it is this, becauſe that although Chriſt in love to his people did go ſo far as to die for them, even the bitter death of the Croſs, that ſo he might juſtifie them before God; and although he went ſo far as to pour out his ſoul unto death, that by it he might redeem them to God, yet he might have miſcarryed in the work, he might not have been able to have given juſtice its full ſatisfaction, and ſo he might have been held under the power of ſin and the grave himſelf; and ſo all the Elect have as really periſhed in him their ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> as they had done before in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> not that any thing of this nature could have been, but the ſuppoſition may be made for the farther clearing of our matter in hand: But now if the people of God will look to the Incenſe Altar, there they ſhall ſee their ſurety Chriſt ſtanding at Gods right hand Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring for them before the Lord, which clearly ſheweth thus
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93772:90"/> much for our comfort, that as our Saviour took all our ſins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and became guilty with them before the juſtice of God, ſo now its moſt certain he is got clear off from them, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a juſtified perſon, and we in him fully as well, as freely juſtified alſo; otherwayes Chriſt had never ſate down at the right hand of God</p>
                  <p>Now this is that which fills up the comfort of Believers, that Chriſt is tranſlated from the Altar overlaid with Braſs, to the Altar of Incenſe overlaid with Gold, which ſhews that he hath done the work which he came to do for Believers.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that S. <hi>Paul</hi> triumphs ſo over Hell, Sin, Satan, the curſe of the Law and death it ſelf; not ſo much from what Chriſt did at the Brazen Altar of ſatisfaction, as from what Chriſt doth at the Incenſe Altar, therefore it is that the word (Rather) is put upon that, not that the one could be without the other: I mean this, not that we could have been juſtified had not Chriſt died, but S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews you where to go (in doubting ſeaſons) for the greateſt confirmation of your Faith and Comfort, therefore ſaith <hi>S. Paul, Rom 8. 34. Who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, it is Chriſt that died; yea Rather is riſen and ſitteth at the right hand of God, making Interceſſion for us:</hi> Therefore ſoul, with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> lift up thy head and look up to the Incenſe Altar, and there ſhalt thou ſee thy bleſſed ſurety (that once took all thy ſins upon him) yet now he ſits at the right hand of God on the Throne of the Majeſty of Heaven, fully ſet free of all thy ſins, and diſcharged of all thy guilt; Thou maiſt aſſure thy ſelf they will never come into mind more, God can never call them into remembrance more, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34.</p>
                  <p>They can never trouble thee more to condemn or accuſe thee before God. O ſoul, before thy ſins can accuſe or trouble thee, they moſt trouble Chriſt in Heaven, for they are not thine, but Chriſts ſins; I mean, they are ſo accounted to be his, becauſe he hath taken them upon him for thee if thou art a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as its natural for every thing to make to their home or Centre, ſo if ever ſin return again, it will firſt light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus Chriſt: You know the Ant makes to his hill, the Fox
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93772:90"/> when abroad will to his hole, the Bee when abroad will to his hive; and if ever ſin ſwarm again it will to its hive which is Chriſt, for he hath made it his by imputation, and is become the hive of ſin.</p>
                  <p>O doubting ſoul fear it not, if by faith thou didſt ever lay thy ſins upon Jeſus Chriſt; O reſt contented, trouble not thy ſelf about it, for ſin ſhall never trouble either thee or thy ſurety more, Chriſt hath made ſure work with ſin, it ſtands him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſo to do, For it was his ſin, <hi>for it was Chriſt was made ſin for us that knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him, 2 Cor</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                  <p>And let all the Devils in Hell do what they can, yet Chriſt ſhall come the ſecond time without ſin to ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28.</p>
                  <p>The work of the Incenſe Altar which was overlaid with Gold, it was to offer upon it the Incenſe Oblation or Offering, <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Which Incenſe was made of ſweet Spices, as Gumm, Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, and Frankincenſe, Verſe 34. This was (as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid) to pefume all the other Offerings which were offered to God in Sacrifice. This ſhews us the ſecond part of Chriſts work as he is a Believers High Prieſt, whoſe Work and Office as a High Prieſt, as I have hinted already, was not only to offer himſelf up a Sacrifice to God for Believers but alſo to make. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion to God for them, which Interceſſion of Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the work of the Incenſe Altar: Inſomuch that both of theſe works of the two Altars meets in Chriſt the High Prieſt of Believers.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the High Prieſt under the Law (which was a Type of Chriſt our great Goſpel High Prieſt) you may ſee how both theſe works were proper to him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To offer the Sacrifice for the people, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To make Interceſſion for the people, <hi>Lev. 9. 22. And Aaron lifted up his hands and bleſsed the people, and came down from Offering the Offering for ſin, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offering.</hi> So <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 11, 12, 13. which bleſſing of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is as much as to ſay his praying for the people; for ſo much
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93772:91"/> the lifting up of hands doth import, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 11. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. that God would pardon their ſin, accept their ſacrifices, and ſend them the bleſſings of this life, and that which is to come. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 55, 56, 57 both of which works in the High Prieſt under the Law, doth the Apoſtle apply to Chriſt, and ſhews (as I have already ſaid) That Chriſt was the Anti-type of the Jews High Prieſt in theſe two works. 1. Of offering the ſacrifices. 2. In making Interceſſion for the people, ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb. 8. 3. For every High Prieſt is ordained to offer gifts and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, wherefore it is neceſſary that this man</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>ſhould have ſomewhat to offer.</hi> Now what is it that this man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the Believers High Prieſt was to offer in ſacrifice to God for the people; look into the 9th. Chap. 26. verſe, and there it is told you what it was, ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>But now in the end of the world hath he appeared</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſame Apoſtle tells you that Chriſt hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work to do as our High Prieſt, beſides the offering up of himſelf as a ſacrifice to God for Believers, and that is the work of Interceſſion or praying to God continually for all manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of bleſſings for his Saints, which relate to this life and that which is to come, <hi>Heb. 7. 24, 25. But this man</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he continueth, ever hath an unchangeable Prieſthood, What to do?</hi> Verſe 25. <hi>for ever to make Interceſſion for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now about the Office or Work of Chriſt as an Interceſſour, there are theſe things conſiderable. Firſt, The work it ſelf. Secondly, The time of it how long it ſhall laſt. Thirdly, The end or purpoſe of the work. All this you may ſee held out to you in the Incenſe Altar, which was the Type of this work of Chriſts conſtant interceeding for his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 7, 8. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>1. Firſt there is the work it ſelf, Verſe 7. <hi>And Aaron ſhall burn thereon ſweet Incenſe every morning when he dreſſeth the Lamps he ſhall burn the Incenſe upon it.</hi> So that there is a work of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the High Prieſt to do, which High Prieſt now is Jeſus Chriſt; therefore faith the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 21. with 25. <hi>The Lord ſware and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever</hi> (meaning
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93772:91"/> Chriſt) <hi>after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi> Now what was the work of <hi>Mechiſedeck,</hi> was it not to offer up prayers to God on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the people, that God would bleſs them with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of his love and favour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18, 19. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1. Therefore the Apoſtle adds this paſſage after that he hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you that Chriſt was (in the work of his Interceſſion) the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of <hi>Melchiſedeck, Heb.</hi> 5. 6, 7. Where ſpeaking of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Who in the days of his fleſh offered up prayers and ſupplications, with tears and ſtrong crys unto him that was able to ſave him from death.</hi> Now you muſt not think that Chriſt in his crys, and tears, and ſupplications, only prayed for himſelf at that time; No, no, but for all the Elect who at that time met in Chriſt, as the Body united to the Head, and ſo he is to be underſtood as our interceeding High Prieſt, praying to God for us againſt the evil of death. So ver. 10. This was done as he was called of God according to the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck:</hi> That is, as he is a High Prieſt, for ſo was <hi>Melchiſedeck, Heb.</hi> 7. 1. whoſe work was to bleſs <hi>Abraham</hi> a Member of this Prieſthood, <hi>grace and mercy, Gen.</hi> 14. therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 7. 25. Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them,</hi> therefore ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, ver. 26. <hi>Such an High Prieſt became us.</hi> And as Chriſt did pour out his crys and ſupplications with tears here on earth, it was to give Believers a comfortable view and ſight of what he is ever doing for them in heaven, of which they may aſſure themſelves to the utmoſt. Therefore doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much comfort Believers againſt all fear of a total miſcarriage; for it cannot be becauſe Chriſt as our great High Prieſt did not only interceed againſt it on earth, by pouring out ſtrong crys and ſupplications, with tears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. but he is doing of the ſame work now he is in heaven, with as much fervency of Spirit for us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ver. 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt that died; yea rather is riſen again, and ſitteth at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us:</hi> Now that the Inteceſſion Chriſt makes is a work of prayer which he poureth forth for his people to God evermore, as that which the Golden Altar for Incenſe was a Type of, will appear if we conſider that place in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93772:92"/> 
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 2, 3, 4. 5. with chap. 1. 13. <hi>And I ſaw the ſeven Angels which ſtood before God, and to them were given ſeven Trumpets; and another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar</hi> (which Angel was Chriſt) <hi>having a golden Cenſer in his hand, and there was given unto him much Incenſe that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the Golden Altar which was before the Throne, and the ſmoak of the Incenſe which came up with the prayers of the Saints aſcending up before God out of the Angels hand.</hi> Now look into <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13. and you may ſee who this Angel was; <hi>And in the midst of the ſeven golden Candleſticks one like unto the Son of men, clothed with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you have the Son of man repreſenting himſelf to <hi>John</hi> after he aſcends up into Glory, ſtanding in the garb of the High Prieſt, for ſo the legal High Prieſt was attired when he was to adminiſter before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>That ſo we might underſtand for our great comfort, that he is doing the great work of the Prieſthood now in Heaven, for his people that are yet without the Tabernacle, as to their being in this life, even for thoſe that are not entred within the veil of bleſſed glory and immortality: So that you ſee that Chriſt is an interceeding High Prieſt now in heaven pouring out his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing prayers to God for his. And this is the matter of the work of Interceſſion.</p>

                  <p>O then what cauſe have Believers to bleſs God for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that there is an Interceſſour provided for them, that can and will prevaile on their behalf, if loud crys and ſtrong ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications attended with many tears will do it. O my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, this is an ineſtimable bleſſed privilege to Believers, that they have ſuch an interceeding High Prieſt as Jeſus is, who is heard in all things and denied in nothing that he ſhall requeſt the Father for on the behalf of Believers: We uſe to ſay that man is happy that hath a Friend in Court to ſpeak, if need be, on his behalf</p>
                  <p>O but how much more happy are Believers that have a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93772:92"/> Chriſt, a High Prieſt in heaven to agitate all their matters and concernments for them there.

                  <p>O then let this bleſſed Doctrine adminiſter comfort to the people of God at all times, in all conditions, that they have a High Prieſt in Heaven interceding for them at Gods right hand.</p>
                  <p>O Brethren! of whom ſhould Believers be afraid that have ſuch an interceding Prieſt as Chriſt is; what if all the Tyrants in the world, and Devils in hell ſhould ſet themſelves together againſt the poor Lambs of Chriſt; O fear them not, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not a hair of your heads fall to the ground. O you Saints, lift up your heads and be not ſo fearful of your Adverſaries, it is your High Prieſts work in heaven to pray you down delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the hands of Men and Devils: Read that comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. When <hi>Amaleck</hi> came out to fight againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> its ſaid that all the while that <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up his hands to God in a way of Prayer and Interceſſion for <hi>Iſrael, Iſrael</hi> prevailed over <hi>Amaleck.</hi> O then ſhall the liftings up of the hands of a <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo much prevail for Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a time of danger (and yet <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a ſervant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5) and ſhall we think that the lifting up of the interceding hands of Chriſt, (who is the Son) ſhall not prevail over theſe <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> which Believers ſtand in doubt of here: O Brethren, do not diſhonour the interceding Office of Jeſus Chriſt your High Prieſt, in giving way ſo much to your fears; Remember what our Saviour ſpake in his own caſe, the ſame he can and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93772:93"/> will do in the caſe of his people, ſo far as it ſhall ſtand with his glory and a Believers good, <hi>Matth. 26. 53. Think you not, and I can pray to my Father, and he can give me more then twelve Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels:</hi> What work did that Angel make which Chriſt prayed down for the relief of his Church in the time of their diſtreſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 36. How did the Angel ſcatter in one night that proud Blaſphemous Army; and ſhall we think that Chriſts Prayers have loſt their Efficacy through length of time; No, no, <hi>he is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13. 8. And ſo in all other exigencies and ſtraits, whether in Famine, Plague, Peſtilence, or what ever the providence be which may occaſion fear. Here is a ſufficient Balm for the ſoul in theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yea in a word, if thou wert brought ſo low with thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, as that thou couldſt not put up one word in prayer to God thy ſelf in the greateſt neceſſity, thou mighſt comfort thy ſelf in this, thy High Prieſt is praying for thee; for ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. This is the ground why thy barrel of Meal waſteth not, and thy Cruſe of Oil ſpend not it ſelf in time of Famine, and why the Plague cometh not nigh thy dwelling place in peſtilentious ſeaſons, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 17, 18, to 23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The next thing we are to ſpeak of is the time how long this is to laſt, or how long this interceding work of Chriſt was to continue for Believers; not only for the Saints under the Old Teſtament ſeaſons, but for the Saints under the New Teſtament ſeaſons alſo, even for us ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. And ſuch a High Prieſt became us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. And this will further appear if you conſider this work in the Type of it, as its held out to you, <hi>Exod. 30. 8. And when Aaron lighted the lamps at even, he ſhall burn Incenſe upon it, a perpetual Incenſe before the Lord, throughout your Generations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now obſerve, it was perpetually to burn before the Lord throughout their Generations; there was not a Generation but muſt have the benefit of this Altar of Incenſe, ſo is Chriſt an Interceſſour for the Elect in all Generations, and not only for time either of the day or of the night, but Chriſt is pouring out his interceding groans to the Father for his people. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93772:93"/> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. He ever liveth to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</p>

                  <p>O ſoul then doubt not, thy caſe goeth on in Heaven well enough, there is alwayes prayer going up to God for thee, to keep thee night and day from danger; ſo long as <hi>Moſes</hi> his hands were kept up by <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> it went well enough with <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 17. O but here are the hands of Chriſt lifted up for thee night and day, to keep thee from the Arrow that flieth by day, and the ſhaft which flieth by night; Read that place, <hi>Iſa. 27. 2, 3. In that day ſing ye a Vineyard of Red Wine, I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment least any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</hi> O Chriſt is interceding night and day for thee againſt all evils; It may be thou feareſt that ſin and corruption will undo thy ſoul, that the Devil and temptation will be thy ruine, that wicked men will ſwallow thee up in the end: O ſoul look up to Jeſus Chriſt under all this, eye him at the Throne of grace wreſtling by his ſtrong crys for thee; O ſoul live upon this in doubting ſeaſons; O go on in the way of thy duty with chearfulneſs; O remember the Lord is with thee, his Spirit ſhall be with thee, his Prayers with thee; O fear not: O ſaith <hi>David, The Lord is on my ſide, I will not fear what man can do unto me.</hi> O ſoul whatever thy danger be that ſhall beſet thee, whether it be from Hell or this World, it can never ſeize thee while Chriſt is at prayer for thee, but Chriſt as thou haſt heard, ever liveth to intercede on thy behalf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay then, why are men ſo ſtrict to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the people to pray, is it not enough that Chriſt their High Prieſt prayeth for them in Heaven?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It is true, in point of prevailing with God for the Elect, ſo Chriſt their High Prieſt prayeth enough for them; And in this ſenſe there is no need of Believers praying, I mean ſo as if their prayers did give any ſtrength to the Prieſtly work, or office of Jeſus Chriſt, therefore that curſed Tenent of the Papiſt is to be abhorred by all true Chriſtians, which teacheth
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93772:94"/> that the prayers of the Church meriteth or procureth the grace of God by its own ſtrength or efficacy, blindly miſtaking that place, <hi>James 5. 16. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> Now in this ſenſe there is no need of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers prayers, for this will be to deſtroy the Mediator-ſhip of Chriſt, and to render his Prieſtly office of no effect; for in point of merit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> worth God only accepts of the prayers of Chriſt, and of the Elects for his ſake, according to that word in <hi>Matth. 3. 17 This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, notwithſtanding the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, yet in point of obedience to God it is a Chriſtians duty to pray; So much as this is handed out to you in the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of old: Read <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 8, 9, 10. Speaking of <hi>Zecharias</hi> the Prieſt, <hi>While he was executing the Prieſts office before God in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his courſe, according to the cuſtom of the Prieſts office, his lot was to burn Incenſe when he went into the Temple of the Lord, and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of the Incenſe.</hi> Now <hi>Zecharias</hi> the Prieſt repreſents our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in the work of his Prieſtly interceding office for the Elect, and you read that nowithſtanding <hi>Zecharias</hi> was interceding at the Incenſe Altar within the Temple, yet the people were to pray at the ſame time without; ſtrongly proving, that although Jeſus Chriſt our Goſpel High Prieſt ſtill intercedes in Heaven for the Elect; yet notwithſtanding it is highly the duty of all the Elect (while without the Temple of glory, and remain yet in the body) to pray: This will farther appear if you conſider that place in <hi>Rev. 8. 3, 4. And another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar having a golden Cenſer in his hand, and there was given unto him much Incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the Golden Altar which was before the Throne, and the ſmoak of the Incenſe which came up with the prayers of the Saints aſcended up before God out of the Angels hand.</hi> If you would know who this Angel was; or is, you may read <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13. and there you ſhall (as I have ſaid already) find him to be Jeſus Chriſt, in all his Prieſtly Formalities as our High Prieſt; And in this Chapter he is ſet forth to you in the performance of his work of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the Saints, by having a Golden Cenſer in his hand;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93772:94"/> which was what the High Prieſt under the Law did adminiſter before the Lord withall, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 46, 47. And the Angel had Incenſe given him to offer up to God in the Cenſer which was in his hand; which Incenſe I underſtand to be meant the infinite worth of his bloud and righteouſneſs, which is continually plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Chriſt, as a ground of full ſatisfaction to God for the Elect: Its ſaid there was much Incenſe given to this Angel, that is, as the Apoſtle elſewhere ſaith, in <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. It pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in him ſhould all fullneſs dwell, which ſheweth the abundant worth and efficacy that lay in the death and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt; therefore he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all thoſe that come to God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. And to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation in his bloud for the ſins of the whole world, <hi>John</hi> 1. 2, 2. That is, there was ſo much Incenſe given this Angel by the Lord, or ſo much vertue put into the death of Chriſt (that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was never intended for all the world) yet there is a vertue or a ſufficiency in his death able to ſave all the world at once. And its ſaid the Angel offered Incenſe, that is, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was interceding at the Throne of grace for the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Now pray obſerve, all this was done with the prayers of all Saints, ſo that the Saints are ſet forth as a praying people as well as Chriſt is ſet forth as an interceding High Prieſt, Chriſts prayers and his peoples prayers going up together before the Lord, make up the great cloud of Incenſe which went up from the Altar.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the point cleared, that Chriſts interceding in Heaven at his Fathers right hand for Believers, doth not give any liberty to the leaſt neglect in prayer here on earth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth our High Prieſt himſelf enjoyn prayer to be made by the Saints that live under his Prieſthood, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26 41. And farther ſays, that men ought to pray always, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. So likewiſe the Apoſtles of Chriſt, they tell you that the ſubjects of this Goſpel Prieſthood muſt pray, <hi>James</hi> 5. 13. and that they muſt pray every where, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. and that without ceaſing, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17 and that men ſhould continue inſtant in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 22. and that men ſhould pray always night and day, <hi>Eph,</hi> 6.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93772:95"/> 18. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3, 10. and for one another, <hi>James</hi> 5. 16. with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that it muſt be in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. likewiſe this hath been made the Character of a good man, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11, and on the contrary, a prayerleſs heart is looked upon in Scripture to be a wicked heart, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly, I come to ſpeak of the end or main pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the work of the Incenſe Altar, or of the work of Chriſts Interceſſion, which he driveth on in Heaven for Believes: Now the purpoſe of this glorious work of Chriſts Interceſſion, it was to make Reconciliation for ſin, or amongſt many other things, one main<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thing was this; (<hi>viz.</hi>) the keeping up a conſtant peace between God and the Soul, therefore it was called the office for atonement, <hi>Exod. 30. 10. And Aaron ſhall make an atonement upon the horns of the Incenſe Altar once a year with the bloud of the ſin offering of atonements, once in the year ſhall he make atonement upon it throughout your Generations, its most holy to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This the Apoſtle applies to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 17. where you have the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt as our Goſpel High Prieſt, ſucceeding <hi>Aaron</hi> of old, the Apoſtle hath this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it in Verſe 17. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a merciful High Prieſt in things pertaining to God, and that he might make Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for the ſins of the people:</hi> Note here, That he might make Reconciliation for the ſins of the people, or an atonement, which is all one; ſo that this was the end or purpoſe of the High Prieſts atonement, it was to keep peace between God and the people under the Law; this you may ſee, read <hi>Numb. 16. 46, 47, 48. And Moſes ſaid to Aaron, take the Cenſer and put fire therein off the Altar, and put on Incenſe, and go quickly unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and make an atonement for them, for there is wrath gone out from the Lord, the Plague is begun: And Aaron took as Moſes commanded him, and ran into the midst of the Congregation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Plague was begun among the people, and he put on Incenſe, and made an atonement for the people; and he ſtood between the dead and the living and the Plague was ſtayed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee clearly what the purpoſe and end of the Prieſts
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93772:95"/> interceding or making atonement for the people amounts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it is to interpoſe between Gods wrath and the people, or to keep God at peace with the people; which is the proper work of Jeſus Chriſt now in glory, to make peace for the Saints, and to interpoſe by his Interceſſion between the anger of God and their ſinning ſouls, who labours by thoſe ſtrong cries, ſighs, and groans, with many tears which cannot be uttered, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God that he would be pleaſed for his own death and righteouſneſs ſake, to paſs by thoſe many ſins, failings, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities which his people are apt to commit; And as in the like caſe we read of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32. 11, 12, 13. So doth Chriſt (of whom in the work of Interceſſion <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Type) caſt himſelf at the feet of God, praying, begging, intreating, that he would be pleaſed to paſs by the ſins and daily infirmities of his people, and not remember their iniquities againſt them, but that he would, extend his Love, Favour, and Grace to their ſouls as afore-time, and would lead them and conduct them by his ſpecial grace to the good land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which was purchaſed for them by his own bloud upon the Croſs at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and begs his Father that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to look more upon his bloud and righteouſneſs for them, and leſs upon their ſins; And doth confeſs as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, that the people are, and ever have been, a ſtiff-necked and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people ever ſince he knew them, but yet ſtill crys, good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put up all the injuries done againſt thy glory by this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and let not thy wrath wax hot againſt the ſheep of thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; O remember the promiſes which thou haſt made to me concerning this people: That a ſeed ſhould ſerve me, &amp; a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men ſhould call me bleſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 30. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 17. And that I ſhould ſee of the travel of my ſoul and be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. and therefore prays that the Father would conſider what loſs it would be to him (who was his Son) ſhould the people miſcarry, how all his ſufferings would be loſt, the end of his coming in the fleſh would be loſt, the fruit of all his Sermons, works of Miracles, and works of Righteouſneſs, would be loſt, therefore in <hi>John</hi> 17. 24.

O let not the Wolves catch any comfort from hence, this is what belongs to the true ſheep of Chriſt, and to none elſe; This is not for him that will catch at any comfort to protect himſelf in a trade of ſin; but this truth chiefly belongs to thoſe that are indeed truly humbled under, and burthened with, the ſenſe of the weight of ſin: To ſuch only I ſpeak; do your ſins preſs you down as a Cart is preſſed with ſheaves? Do your iniquities ſo weigh down your heads as that you cannot look up? Dare not you come to God nor ſtand in his preſence? Do you fear that your ſins have provoked God againſt you? Do you doubt the Plague is begun againſt you? are you fearful the wrath of God is coming out upon you and that it may prove ſuch a ſtorm as may ſink you into the loweſt Hell? Yet O look up to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding High Prieſt who is now in Heaven for you, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prevail upon the heart of God for pardoning grace on your behalf, who likewiſe makes it his buſineſs to obſerve his Fathers countenance towards Believers, that if at any time his face of Juſtice begins to look grim, and he perceives that wrath begins to come forth, he may as <hi>Aaron</hi> did, ſtep quickly in between God and the people, and ſo by his interpoſing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of grac, eand powerful Interceſſion, he may allay the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Father again.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that <hi>John</hi> comforts doubting, drooping ſouls in his day with this truth, becauſe indeed it is a truth proper to that end and purpoſe, and farther, <hi>John</hi> the Divine doth not only apply this truth as a Cordial to bear them up under the ſenſe of ſin, but likewiſe as a notable preſervative againſt the act of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93772:96"/> 
                     <hi>ſin,</hi> 1 John 2. 1, 2. <hi>My little children I write unto you that you ſin not; and if any man ſin we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous; and he is a propitiation in his blood for our ſins, and not onely for ours, but for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> O Soul, live upon this bleſſed truth, ſtay thy ſelf here under all thy doubtings. O conſider, ſin may vex and diſquiet thee, but all cannot hurt thee, ſo long as Chriſt keeps up his praying hands to God for thee it ſhall not do thy ſoul the leaſt injury. Chriſt doth prevail, and he will prevail in heaven for thee againſt ſin and wrath: Chriſt lies in the way of his Fathers wrath, as it were, if any of it run forth it muſt paſs through Chriſt; he ſtands between the Father and thy Soul in a time of the Fathers diſpleaſure, and cryes out, good Father ſtay thy wrath! O hold thy hands, ſtrike not this poor ſinner; if thou ſtrikeſt I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the blows ſhall alight all on my back; I will bear all, and ſuffer all, and take all, both fault and puniſhment upon my ſelf. This the Father tried once and it proved true, when the Father went to ſtrike the Elect, the blows fell all upon Chriſts own back, which bruiſed him very much, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 1. which leads me to a fifth uſe of the Point.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 25.</hi> Of the Brazen Laver.</head>
               <p>I Now come to ſpeak of the brazen Laver which was for this purpoſe, that the Prieſts might waſh themſelves therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went into the Tabernacle to perform the Worſhp and Service thereof, <hi>Exod. 30. 18, 19, 20. Thou ſhalt alſo make a laver of Braſs, and his foot alſo of Braſs to waſh withal, and thou ſhalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the Altar; and thou ſhalt put water therein, for Aaron and his ſons ſhall waſh their hands and their feet thereat when they go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation: they ſhall waſh with water that they die not, or when they come near unto the Altar to miniſter to burn offerings made by fire unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This brazen Laver was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt, and the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing water which was in it, typed out the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which onely can cleanſe poor ſouls, and waſh them from their ſinful guiltineſs, and ſinful filthineſs: for as the Prieſts under the Law were to waſh themſelves in the brazen Laver before they were thought fit to have to do, either with the holy God of Worſhip, or the holy things of the Worſhip of God; ſo are all the Elect, firſt by Faith to waſh themſelves in the Blood of Chriſt, this ſpiritual brazen Laver, before they are thought fit to have to do either with God or his Worſhip.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:93772:97"/>
               <p>Hence is that cleanſing attributed to the Blood of Chriſt ſo often in Scripture, to ſhew you it performs the ſame uſe to the Goſpel Prieſts (for ſo doth the Goſpel term every Believer now, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6.) as the Laver water did to the legal Prieſts, 1 <hi>John 1. 7. The blood of Jeſus that cleanſeth us from all ſin:</hi> ſo <hi>Rev. 1. 5. To him that loved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his own Blood.</hi> Now in this chapter of <hi>Revelations</hi> you may ſee by the order of the words in verſe 5, 6. how the Holy Ghoſt makes the type and the antitipe to agree. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 19. you have the brazen Laver ſet up now: in the 5. verſe of this chapter you have Chriſt ſet out to you, performing the ſame uſe and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in waſhing and cleanſing. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 19. you have the ſubjects ſpoken of who they ſhould be which ſhould waſh in the brazen Laver, and theſe were <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons: now you know theſe were Prieſts. Now look into <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. there the ſubjects ſpoken of which muſt waſh in the Laver of Chriſts Blood, they are called Prieſts likewiſe, which intends all believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in and under the Goſpel: all thoſe which have waſhed in the Blood of Chriſt our Goſpel brazen Laver, they are now all accounted prieſts as well as kings to God.</p>

               <p>THus having ended with the ſeveral particulars in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, I now come to ſpeak of the anointing of the Tabernacle:</p>
               <p>For we find that when <hi>Moſes</hi> had finiſhed the Tabernacle with the ſeveral Veſſels thereof, all this was to be anointed all over with Oil, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 9, 10. Now the Veſſels that were in the Tabernacle, as they had reference to Chriſt (as hath been ſhewed you) ſo alſo do they refer to the Individuals of the Church of God; this you may ſee in <hi>Zach. 14. 20, 21. In that day ſhall there be upon the Bells of the Horſes holineſs to the Lord, and the Pots in the Lords houſe ſhall be like the bouls before the Altar, for every Pot in Jeruſalem and in Judah ſhall be holineſs to the Lord:</hi> That is, every true ſervant of the Lord ſhall be under a great ſpirit of holineſs in the latter Ages of the world.</p>

                  <head>Uſe 1.</head>
                  <p>It ſerves to inform us of theſe two things: Firſt that the leaſt member in the Church of God is appointed for ſome uſe, you know there were ſeveral Veſſels and Inſtruments in the Tabernacle, as the Pots, the Caldrons, the Fleſh-hooks, the Fire-pans, the Snuffers, and the like; now though theſe did differ in glory the one from the other (for all had not alike meaſure of glory upon them, neither were they all alike em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſame kind of work) yet the leaſt Inſtrument or Veſſel in the Tabernacle was employed, and was of uſe, even to the Tongs and Fire-pan, both which were to right up the Coals on the Altar, and to carry forth the Aſhes of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Oh ſo it is in the Church of God, there is not one there in that Body or Tabernacle but was appointed for uſe in the Church, though their work may differ and their gifts may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, yet there is work to employ all; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Where the Apoſtle tells you that there be given to the Church a diverſity of gifts and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for every man to profit withall, in Verſe 10. <hi>To one is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the working of Miracles, to another divers kinds of Prophecy, to another diſcerning of Spirits, to another divers kinds of Tongues, to another the Interpretation of Tongues; but all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf ſame Spirit, dividing to every man ſeverally as he will:</hi> So that you ſee every one in the Church of God is of ſome uſe or other, for every one hath his proper gift, every Chriſtian in his place muſt do ſomething in his Generation to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will ſay their gifts are ſmall, and their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſmall, and they can do but little?</p>

Oh let not the weakeſt Chriſtian ſet himſelf aſide to ſay I can do no work for God, I want theſe gifts and parts which ſome have, and therefore I can do little. O ſoul, though thou art but the fire-pan in the Church, yet here is work to be done for thee, though it be but to rid out the dung of the Sanctuary.

                  <p>Secondly, It may inform us what the Children of God are and ought to be, the holy ſanctified ones of the times: You read what God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to do to the veſſels in the Tabernacle; when they were framed and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh ſo hath the Father anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every true Believer with the oyl of Grace which came down from Chriſt: ſo ſaith <hi>John 1. 16.

               <p>I Come now to ſpeak of the out-ſide coverings of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle which comprehended all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now the coverings were of two ſorts, which we may call the inward or the outward coverings.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the inward covering, and that was very glorious.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the outward covering, and that was as mean and uncomely.</p>
               <p>As for the inward covering you may read what is ſaid of that, <hi>Exod. 36. 8. And every wiſe-hearted man amongſt them that wrought the work of the Tabernacle, made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue purple, and ſcarlet, with Cherubims of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning work made he them:</hi> you may likewiſe ſee the outward coverings of the Tabernacle which ſeems to be as uncomely as the other are comely and glorious, Ver. 14. with 19. <hi>And he made curtains of Goats hair for the tent over the Tabernacle,</hi> ver. 19 <hi>And he made a covering for the tent of Rams skins dyed red, and a covering of Badgers skins above that.</hi> Suitable to which coverings is the ſtate and condition of the Church of God, is it relates either to God or this world.</p>
               <p>Firſt as it relates to God, ſo the covering that is upon the Church is very beautiful &amp; glorious, which anſwereth to the coverings about the Tabernacle made of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and ſcarlet, with Cherubims of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93772:101"/> work, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. 8. Which holds out to us the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt with which the Church is cloathed withall; which covering makes the Church truly beautiful and glorious in the eyes of God, when this bleſſed covering of Chriſts Righteouſneſs is put upon and hanged about the Church, then doth the Church look fair in Gods account, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col. 2. 10. And yea are complete in him who is the head of all Principalities and Powers:</hi> That is, when the Church is cloathed upon with this covering of Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, then are you complete (who are of that Church) in Gods ſight, not elſe.</p>
               <p>2. Beſides the Tabernacle covering agrees to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt (I mean the Inner of the two coverings) if we conſider the obſcurity of the Tabernacle covering, it was not what was to be ſeen by every beholder, for this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering was hid from the beholder by reaſon of another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering which was made of Rams skins, and caſt over it: Read <hi>Exod,</hi> 36. 14. with ver. 19. So it is in the caſe of the Churches greateſt glory in this life, the Churches greateſt glory and beauty doth conſiſt of a being cloathed with the Garments of Chriſts Righteouſneſs. But its a glory veiled up from the eyes of the moſt of men, there is a covering of Rams skins drawn over it, which keeps the ſight of this glory from men; there is nothing but an eye of Faith can diſcern this, therefore is the glory of the Church ſaid to be a hidden glory from the world; men as men, ſee little into it or know little of it, <hi>Pſalm 45. 13. The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, all her cloathing is of wrought Gold.</hi> But however, though in the account of men the Church of Chriſt ſeems to be poor, and mean, and worthleſs, yet becauſe of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt with which ſhe is cloathed, ſhe is very beautiful, and glorious, and lovely in Gods eyes, <hi>Cant. 1. 9, 10. I have compared thee, Oh my love, to a company of Horſes in Pharoahs Chariots, thy cheeks are comely with rows of Ienels, thy neck with chains of Gold;</hi> So ver. 15. <hi>Behold thou art fair my love, behold thou art fair, thou haſt doves eyes;</hi> So Iſa. 43, 34.

                  <p>O then how ſhould the thoughts of this wonderfully raiſe and comfort the hearts of the people of God, eſpecially in two ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt in doubting ſeaſons, when a poor Soul lieth burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under the ſence of his perſonal vileneſs and polluted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before God, which oftentimes weakens the ſouls confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, and keeps the ſoul at a diſtance with God, who thinks that as he ſeems in his own eyes, ſo he doth in the eyes of God; Oh ſoul remember the Tabernacle covering, that glorious wrought piece w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> had the Cherubims wrought in it, which Cherubims were the Emblems and Signs of mercy; in which covering God looks upon all Believers, not as they are in themſelves but as they are and do appear before him in the righteouſneſs of his Son, which covering hides all thy filth, and iniquity, and infirmities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pſal. 32. 1. Bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered;</hi> So that you ſee there is that which doth cover tranſgreſſion, and hide iniquity, that it cannot appear before God to condemn the ſoul, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now no condemnation to a ſoul in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs is ſuch a covering for, and to the Church, as that it doth not only hide ſin, pollution, and a thouſand times ten thouſand infirmities, but alſo it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the ſoul to God in its own dreſs, and ſo draws forth the love of God and the delight of God to the creature, as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93772:102"/> if the creature had never ſinned, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 26. 27. Husbands love your wives as Chriſt hath loved the Church and given himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it by the waſhing of water and the word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot, or wrinckle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the Spouſe in <hi>Cant.</hi> doth notably diſtinguiſh her condition in this caſe, as ſhe ſaw her ſelf in her ſelf, and as by faith ſhe ſaw her ſelf in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Secondly but as ſhe looked upon her ſelf in Chriſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with his Righteouſneſs, ſo ſhe cryeth out ſhe was as comely as the curtains of <hi>Solomon,</hi> there ſhe knew ſhe was without ſpot or wrinkle in Gods ſight, and in the worſt of times could go with boldneſs to the Throne of grace to ask grace and mercy to help in time of need, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. here it was in his covering that <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be found in above any place or ſtate in the world for juſtification: <hi>Phil. 3. 9.

                  <p>Secondly, this will adminiſter great comfort to the ſoul in times of Perſecution, when the Church ſhall be buffeted, and ſlandered, and ſlighted and ſcorned, and caſt out as evil, and accounted the dung of the times, then may the people of God comfort themſelves in this truth, though men ſlight them, yet God doth not, though they ſee no beauty in us yet God doth, and he ſaith in all the reproaches we meet with we are honourable and precious in his ſight, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45, 3, 4.

                  <p>I come now to ſpeak unto the outward coverings, which covered or comprehended all the reſt of coverings or things in the Tabernacle, and this covering had very little or no beauty in it, there was nothing in it to delight the eye of the beholder at all, the materials of it are ſo mean and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, for they did conſiſt of Goats hair, and Rams skins dyed red, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. 14. with 19. which was ſo faſtned together by

                  <p>With what little out-ſide glory doth God cloath his Church in this world, the Church comes with little of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſhe is not cloathed with the Pomp, Glory, Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and worldly Felicities of this life; the great pomp of this world belongs to the Church of Anti-chriſt, not to Chriſts Church; the great Titles of Honour, great Places, and alſo to be called of men <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi,</hi> dwells in the Cup of Fornication, which Myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> hath, who is termed the Mother of Harlots, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 4.

Now this land of reſt, or the end of the wilderneſs journey, I find to be two ways held out in Scripture, either for the ultimate glory above, or for that Kingdom of glory which Chriſt calls his Kingdom, as he is the Son of man which he ſo often promiſeth his people as the reward of their ſufferings for him, for our Saviour makes a clear difference between the Kingdom of ultimate glory above, and the Kingdom of glory which Chriſt hath promiſed to give his people for their Faith, Love, and Conſtancy to him in ſuffering-times, pray read well and conſider that paſſage of our Saviour, <hi>Rev. 3. 21. To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me on my Throne, even as I have overcome, and am ſet down with my Father on his Throne.</hi> Mark that there is the Fathers Throne of glory, and there is the Sons Throne of glory, mine ſaith Chriſt and my Fathers; now one of theſe Thrones or Kingdoms of glory hath Chriſt made the proper reward of the Saints ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and that is, what he calls his Kingdom, a Kingdom diſtinct from the Fathers, <hi>Rev. 3. 21. I will grant him to ſit with me upon my Throne;</hi> which is promiſed the Saints ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the word of truth, <hi>Math. 19. 28. Rev. 2. 26, 27. Rev. 20. 4. Rev.</hi> 21. 2, 3. Now all theſe Scriptures relate to the Kingdom of Chriſt, this none will deny.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That this Kingdom is held out to the Saints, and promiſed them as the reward of their ſufferings, it muſt alſo be granted.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That this Kingdom thus promiſed to the Saints as the reward of their ſufferings cannot be applyed to the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate glory, will appear if we look into each Scripture, neither can men read theſe Scriptures ſo, without being guilty of putting meer Nonſenſe upon the face of Scipture;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93772:106"/> Pray let us look into theſe places, <hi>Math. 19. 28. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of man ſhall ſit upon the throne of his glory, ye alſo ſhall ſit upon 12. thrones judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</hi> Now this very promiſe is again hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by our Saviour (after his Aſcenſion) to <hi>John</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> Rev. 3. 2. <hi>To him that overcometh I will grant to ſit with me on my throne;</hi> Look into <hi>Rev.</hi> 20 4. There you have the ſame promiſe applyed to his proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which were ſuffering Saints: <hi>and I ſaw thrones, and they that ſate upon them, and Judgement was given unto them, and I ſaw the Souls of them that were beheaded for the witneſs of Ieſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhipped the beaſt, neither his Image, neither had received his mark upon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, nor in their hands, and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years.</hi> Now the Queſtion will be, whether this Text do neither relate to the Kingdom of ultimate glory, taking its riſe from the general Judgment day mentioned <hi>Math.</hi> 2. 5. 31, 32. Or whether it relates to the ſetting up of Chriſts Kingdom here on Earth which is mentioned, <hi>Dan. 2. 44. And in the days of theſe Kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a Kingdom which ſhall never be deſtroyed, and the Kingdom ſhall not be left to another people, but it ſhall break in pieces and conſume all theſe Kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> Now certainly it cannot relate to that Kingdom which takes its riſe from the general Judgment day, becauſe we find the general Judgment day pointed at by the Holy Ghoſt to be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years after this Kingdom begins, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. Where you read after a thouſand years time ſpent in the management and ordering of the Son of mans Kingdom, then the general Judgment day takes its place, as appears from Verſe 11. 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe this Kingdom is to have an end before the other begins, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The great glory reſolves this into it ſelf, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 24. Then cometh the end</hi> (meaning the end of the Son of

                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe this glorious Kingdom of the Son of man promiſed to the Saints, as the reward of their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in holding out and ſuffering for him, is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any part of the ultimate glory above (I mean ſo as to be enjoyed above that its what is expreſly ſaid to come down from that which is above, <hi>Rev. 21. 2, 3. And I John ſaw the holy City, the new Jeruſalem coming down from God out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband, and I heard a great voice ſaying, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi> Another Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which ſpeaks of the Son of mans Kingdom of glory here on Earth is in <hi>Rev. 2. 26, 27, And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations, and he ſhall rule them with a rod of Iron, as the veſsels of a Potter ſhall they be broken to ſhivers, even as I have received of my Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Reader pray read well and conſider theſe words, then give thy thoughts whether any thing in them can be applied to the ultimate glory, not but that I believe the Saints ſhall enter there at laſt, but whether there be not a glorious Kingdom on this ſide that, for the Saints to enjoy as the reward of their ſufferings, which hath its foundation in the Scriptures Now obſerve in the aboveſaid words of <hi>John,</hi> its ſaid in ths Kingdom the Saints ſhall have power over the Nations ſo as to rule ſome, and to break others in pieces with rods of Iron: Now if this muſt relate to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Saints after the laſt and great general Judgment day, behold as I ſaid before, what Nonſenſe we put upon the Scriptures; for according to the Deſcription given of the great and general Judgment day, the wicked muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after ſentence given depart into hell, and the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:93772:107"/> godly ſhall be taken up into heaven, where each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall be to eternity, and ſhall never ſee the face of each other more, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 33. with 41. Well then, according to that of <hi>Math.</hi> 25. The wicked and the godly ſhall be ſo totally ſeparated, as that they ſhall never ſee the face of one another more; then where be the Nations, and who are they that the Saints muſt rule over with Iron rods and break to pieces: Beſides, over whom ſhall the Saints rule in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for there only God ſhall be all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. Again, Iron rods notes ſeverity and bitterneſs; now what of this, do you promiſe your ſelves in Heaven, Heaven knows nothing of that in the leaſt, and to ſay any ſhall rule with Iron rods there, is to ſay that which the word doth not ſay: Therefore be content Chriſtian to travel to the end of thy appointed wilderneſs-journey, &amp; when the time cometh that thou muſt enter into this good land and much promiſed Kingdom, then expect thy Spiritual <hi>Solomon</hi> to turn thy Tabernacle ſtate of deformity into a famous Temple of glory.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 28.</hi> I come now to ſpeak of the High Prieſt under the Law, which was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt alſo.</head>
               <p>IN the handling of which, I ſhall obſerve this method: Firſt, Speak ſomething as to the place out of which the High Prieſt was to be choſen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſpeak of the Qualifications which he was to be endued withall.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:93772:107"/>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſpeak of the Conſecrated Garments which he was to adminiſter in.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I ſhall ſpeak of the manner of the Prieſts Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Of the Work he was to do for the people when choſen for them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As to the place out of which the High Prieſt was to be choſen, (by being choſen) I do not mean that there was ſuch a Cuſtom or Rule amongſt the Jews (before the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption crept into the Jewiſh Church) for the people to chuſe their High Prieſts, but I intend the thing, as it reſpects the firſt ſetting apart of a High Prieſt for the people.</p>
               <p>Now the place from whence the High Prieſt was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it was from amongſt the Children of Iſrael, not from a ſtrange people or Country, <hi>Exod. 28. 1. And take thou unto thee Aaron thy Brother, and his Sons with him, from amongst the Children of Iſrael, that he may Miniſter unto me in the Prieſts Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Particular affords us theſe two Uſes.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe 1.</head>
                  <p>It ſerves to remove out of the way two great Objections, which may abide upon the hearts of ſome tender Souls, who may be unwilling to adventure their caſe in Chriſts hands.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe of their unacquaintance with him, he is too much a ſtranger to them, therefore ſome make no uſe of him for their High Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others call in Queſtion his faithfulneſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others make no uſe of him; that which they have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the High Prieſts care is of an infinite value, its the price of a Soul, which if it ſhould miſcarry through want of faithfulneſs in the Prieſt, they loſe their all, and more then the whole world is worth: Now to prevent theſe Fears and Objections, the Prieſt was to be taken from amongſt his own Brethren, it ſhall be no ſtranger whom you know not,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93772:108"/> or that knows not you, but of your own ſelves, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Brethren, bone of your bone, and fleſh of your fleſh, this yields great relief againſt Fears. Suppoſe the King ſhould ſend an Army over Sea into ſome ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, now if he ſhall make choice of ſome Alien or Outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh man to be General over them, how would this diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Army in their way and work, for who knows but that a ſtranger may ſell them into their Enemies hands; or ſhould he not do ſo, yet he being an Alien, they not known to him, what ever their neceſſities (with reſpect to want of food, clothing, or any other neceſſaries) may be, he cannot underſtand their complaints, and they periſh without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; but now if the General be one of their own Nation, they will not ſo much fear the being betraid into the hands of their enemies, becauſe their General and they are all alike, hateful to the enemy they engage againſt, beſides when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they have any requeſt to put up to him, or matter of moment to inform him withall, they are ſure he knows their language and underſtands their tongue and they his, for he is born of the ſame Nation, a General made of his Brethren. Now as the High Prieſt under the Law was a Type of Chriſt in all reſpects, ſo in this very reſpect likewiſe, that ſo Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers might have great encouragement to apply themſelves to him at all times, hence it is that <hi>Moſes</hi> (alluding to Chriſt ſaith) <hi>Deut. 18. 15. A Prophet ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Oh then, what comfort and encouragement ſhould this afford the ſoul againſt the former Objections: Firſt as to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93772:108"/> their non-acquaintance with him, Oh ſoul thou needſt not fear, for thy High Prieſt is no ſtranger to thee, he is not an Alien which cannot underſtand thy ſpeech, thou maiſt freely lay open thy mind to him in prayer, what ever diſtreſs or want thou art in come to him in prayer and thou needſt not fear he will well know what it is thou ſupplicateſt him about; this it was that encouraged <hi>David</hi> to come to him and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pour out his ſoul to him, he knew that Chriſt was no ſtranger, nor a man of an unknown tongue to him, and he knew that Chriſt could as well underſtand what he had to expreſs on his part of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal. 139. 4. Lord there is not a word in my tongue but thou knoweſt it altogether.</hi> Beſides, Chriſt is ſo well skilled in our tongue that he can throughly judge of our meaning, and broken ſighs and groans delivered up before him, if we want expreſſions he can help the ſoul out in the thing, for he doth not only know what we ſhould ſpeak, but what we would ſpeak before him, and ſo helps us out in the matter, <hi>Rom. 8. 26, 27. Likewiſe the Spirit helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, for we know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh Interceſſion for us with groans which cannot be uttered; and he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh Interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God:</hi> For Chriſt is made a High Prieſt for this end, to ſpread the complaints of his people before the Lord; therefore is it recorded in <hi>Rev. 8. 3. And another Angel ſtood at the Altar having a Golden Cenſer, and there was given him much Incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints:</hi> So that you ſee Chriſt did offer up the complaints, ſighs, and groans of his people to God, therefore muſt he be taken from amongſt his Brethren, a member of the ſame Nation, born and trained up amongſt the people, that ſo he might be fully capable to do them that ſervice for which he was ordained a Prieſt.</p>

                  <p>What encouragement ſhould this Doctrine give a ſoul to adventure his all in the hands of this Chriſt, in point of that faithfulneſs we may expect to find in him meerly upon this account, that he is a High Prieſt called forth to the work from amongſt his Brethren, and then this would remove the other Objection which ſome poor ſoul may make againſt Chriſt; O! That which I have to entruſt the High Prieſt withall is of infinite value, and if it ſhould miſcarry through the unfaithfulneſs of the Prieſt, I am for ever undone, and ſhall never recover my ſelf more: Now to prevent theſe fears, the High Prieſt was to be taken from amongſt his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, a man intereſted with them in all the proyerties toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe happineſs is bound up in the peoples; one who muſt ſtand and fall with thoſe, he is a Prieſt unto who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes but his own in ſeeking the peoples good for whom he undertakes, therefore muſt he be taken from amongſt his Brethren, to aſſure us of his faithfulneſs and diligence in the work he hath undertaken for Believers; you know that Chriſt our High Prieſt is called an Advocate, that is, one that pleads a caſe in Law, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. Now what an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would this afford a perſon to make uſe of ſuch a man in his caſe, who is concerned in the ſame caſe himſelf, ſo as that if it goes ill with the Client it muſt go ill with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate. Oh ſoul, thus much maiſt thou draw out of this particular, of the High Prieſts being taken from amongſt his Brethren, it is to encourage thee to make uſe of Jeſus Chriſt for a High Prieſt to God in the behalf of thy ſoul, thou maiſt aſſure thy ſelf that he will be faithful to thee: No bribes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him can pervert or corrupt him, therefore is he called a righteous Advocate, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous;</hi> the Inheritance which Chriſt as a High Prieſt intercedes for, and as an Advocate pleads for in Heaven its what Chriſt and thee are co-heirs
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93772:109"/> and joynt-heirs of together, <hi>Rom. 8. 17. If Children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with Chriſt:</hi> So that thou ſtandeſt and falleſt with Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt promotes his own Intereſt in promoting thine, if he prove unfaithful its as well to himſelf as to thee; Oh therefore doubt of nothing, put thy all into his hands, adventure whole ſoul and body upon his Prieſthood, thou canſt not do better, that which was <hi>Peters</hi> Exhortation to the Saints in his day, is mine to thee, <hi>Pet. 1. 4, 19. Wherefore let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their ſouls to him in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</hi> Soul, it would be very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for thee to keep this truth always warm upon thy heart that it may give down its daily comfort to thee, that the High Prieſt is thy Brother, for he was taken from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Brethren; it would be the choiceſt food thou canſt live upon in thy wilderneſs condition, if thou wert to take up thy quarters at any time in a Dungeon, yet if thou haſt this pot of Manna with thee (<hi>viz.</hi>) thy Brother is a High Prieſt in Heaven, what more comfortable conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world then this? <hi>David</hi> was wonderfully raiſed in his hopes and expectations from hence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 1. The Lord is my ſheepherd I ſhall not want; that is, he is a Prieſt, whoſe office it is to ſupply the wants of the ſoul in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for ſo much was expected from the High Prieſt under the Law, he was to procure what bleſſings he could for the people, <hi>Numb. 6 23, 24 25, 26. And the Lord ſpake unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſaying, ſpeak unto Aaron and to his Sons, ſaying on this wiſe, ye ſhall bleſs the Children of Iſrael ſaying, the Lord bleſs thee and keep thee, the Lord make his face to ſhine upon thee and be gracious unto thee, the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace.</hi> Now that which greatens this mercy is this, (That as its the Place and Office of Chriſt to ſupply the wants of his people) there is no condition whatſoever that his people are in at any time but Chriſt is privy to it, <hi>Pſal. 139 2, 3. Thou knoweſt my down ſitting and my upriſing, thou underſtandeſt my thoughts afar off, thou compaſs eſt my path and my lying down, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93772:110"/> art acquainted with all my ways.</hi> Herein lay <hi>Davids</hi> great comfort, and the ſame may be thine, that this want-ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſt that was ſo well acquainted with his peoples ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conditions, he could appropriate him to himſelf as his ſheepherd, <hi>The Lord is my ſheepherd</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> that is as if he had ſaid, I draw much of my comfort from the place out of which the Prieſt was to be choſen, which is this, he was to be called forth from amongſt his Brethren, ſo that he is not a ſtranger to me, a man whoſe voice or words I underſtand not, or he mine, but he is my Brother which underſtands my thoughts afar off.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Prieſt was to be a faithful man, a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging his duty with all faithfulneſs and ſincerity towards his people, not ſeeking his own before their good, uſing all diligence in his place and calling, withholding no due right from the people; thus much you have from the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb</hi> 2. 17. Speaking of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a faithful High Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for the ſins of the people:</hi> To be made like unto his Brethren, who are theſe? Anſwer, not only all Believers (for they are called Chriſts Brethren too) but alſo, and moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally (with reſpect to office) by Brethren is meant all thoſe High Prieſts which were before his Incarnation, who were likewiſe the fore-running Types of him in the work of the Prieſthood, and that it was the Prieſts of old that are moſtly intended (in this Text) as the Brethren which Chriſt was to be made like unto will appear, if we conſider the end why the Apoſtle ſaith our Saviour muſt be made like unto his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: It was that he might make Reconciliatien for the ſins of the people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. A work proper to none (under the Law) but to the Prieſts. But wherein was Chriſt to be made like unto his Brethren, you may ſee in the Text, it was in point of faithfulneſs as well as in other reſpects; <hi>That he might be a faithful High Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make Reconciliation for the ſins of the people:</hi> So that you ſee ſo much as this was expected to be found in and from the High Prieſt under the Law, that he ſhould be faithful.</p>
               <p>Now both of the Qualifications in an abundant meaſure, the Apoſtle ſhews you are in Chriſt our Goſpel High Prieſt, for ſo he applies the thing for our comfort, as indeed all this was but to ſet forth the fulneſs of grace which from the Spirit of anointing the Father cauſed to run into Chriſt to fit him for this great work of the Prieſthood, read <hi>Heb.</hi> 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As for the firſt fort of perſons, who yet ſtand off from Chriſt, and are afraid to cloſe with him ſo as to make him their High Prieſt; Oh ſoul, how long wilt thou doubt, and by doubting keep thy ſoul off from Jeſus Chriſt, knoweſt thou not that there is a neceſſity for thee to haſten to Jeſus Chriſt, art thou not convinced that thou art a ſinner and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe, doth not the word tell thee that God is angry with thee every day, <hi>Pſal</hi> 7. 11.

                  <p>Secondly, As for thoſe who have made their choice of Chriſt, but ſtill doubts of their condition; Oh ſoul, didſt thou know how much comfort and ſatisfaction thou maiſt draw out of the Prieſtly office of Chriſt, thou wouldſt never doubt more: I do confeſs that Satan labours to fill the minds of the people of God with great fears and doubtings, but would they view this Qualification (of compaſſion) in their High Prieſt, it would abundantly fortifie them againſt all Objections whatſoever Satan could make againſt them; there be theſe five things which do ordinarily cauſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the hearts of the Lords people,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The guilt of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſtrength of corruption.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The violence of Temptation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The weakneſs of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Their backwardneſs in duty.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If it be the guilt of ſin which cometh in upon thee under all this look up to Chriſt, let it not drive thee from but to Chriſt; for he, full of bowels and tender compaſſion on purpoſe to deal with thee under this diſtemper, take his own words for it, <hi>Art thou laden with thy ſin as that thou canſt not hold up thy head,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>then come to me and I will freely pardon it for my name ſake, though your ſin be as red as Crimſon
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93772:112"/> and as Scarlet, yet I will make them as white as ſnow and as wooll; Iſa.</hi> 1. 18. Is it the power of ſin troubles thee, Oh then look up to Chriſt thy High Prieſt, who is full of compaſſion filled up with it to out-vie thy corruption, the Father was reſolved to bring his elected ones to glory through the Prieſthood of Chriſt, therefore filled Chriſt with infinite affection towards his people, that ſo he might pitty them and have compaſſion on them in all their diſtempers, the people were in an ill caſe in the wilderneſs for want of greater meaſures of this in <hi>Moſes</hi> who had undertaken the conduct of them. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 11, 12 13, 14, 15. <hi>Moſes</hi> crys out, I am not able to bear all this people alone becauſe it is too heavy for me; Oh but its otherwiſe with Chriſt, for the Father was reſolved to fill Chriſt with ſo much compaſſion as that he ſhould never complain of his burthen in having to do with ſuch corrupted ones as thou art, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17 18. For he was made a merciful High Prieſt in things pertaining to God, that he might be able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted, (mark that) to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the tempted or burthened, not to reject them under it: Oh then come to Chriſt, bring thy corruption with thee, lie down with it at the feet of Chriſt and he will unlade thy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for thee, <hi>Math. 11. 28, 29. Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest.</hi> Oh burthened ſoul! here is thy call, what canſt expect more at Chriſts hands then to be bid under this weight of corruption to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to him.</p>
                  <p>But it may be thou wilt ſay, but I am afraid, ſhould I come my corruption would ſtir up fury in my Lord? Soul, Chriſt gives anſwer to it (what wilt thou have more) and bids thee put him upon the trial, for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I am meek and towly in heart, therefore come unto me, Math.</hi> 11. 29. And alſo tells thee that fury is not in him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 4. He means towards ſuch as are burthened with corruption, there is no fury in him againſt ſuch, but rather wounderful love, and tender pity and compaſſion, yea ſo much that Chriſt could and will bear the burthen himſelf rather then it ſhould ſink
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93772:113"/> his poor people, therefore if there be no other help or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to be had againſt the burthen of corruption, we are by Chriſts word exhorted to caſt the burthen upon his ſhoulders, <hi>Pſal. 55. 23. Caſt thy burthen upon the Lord and he ſhall ſuſtain thee, he ſhall never ſuffer the righteous to be moved.</hi> Is it the violence of temptation makes thee to doubt, come to Chriſt, look up to him, he is merciful and full of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, its not thy temptations ſhall alienate Chriſts heart from thee, but rather work his heart to compaſſionate thy condition, Chriſt is ſo merciful as to diſtinguiſh between thy temptation and thy allowing of it and delighting in it, as a tender-hearted Husband would do in the like caſe about his wife; ſuppoſe a woman ſhould be violently ſet upon by ſome wicked perſon and he ſhould be too ſtrong for her and get her under him, and ſhould abuſe her body, her Husband coming in the mean time and finds her in the act, yet when he beholds her ſtrugling and ſtriving with the man to get from him, and when he ſees the tears which dropt from her eyes about it, do you think that this Husband will put her away from him; no, no, but rather embrace her in his arms with all tenderneſs and affection imaginable: Take one comfortable inſtance for this in our Saviours carriage of old in the like caſe, and aſſure thy ſelf what he was in his carriage then he is the ſame ever ſince, and ever will be to his people under their temptations; <hi>For he is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
                  <p>The inſtance you have in <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 1, 2. Where you have <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High Prieſt (who perſonates the whole Church of Chriſt) violently ſet upon by the tempter, who was ſaid to reſiſt <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that is, tempted him and ſtrugled and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with <hi>Joſhua</hi> to have his pleaſure of him to make him, ſin and tranſgreſs againſt Chriſt; but did Chriſt reject <hi>Joſhua</hi> for this and caſt him off, no ſure, but it rather wrought forth his heart towards him with the greateſt pity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, the bowels of Chriſt wrought toward <hi>Joſhua</hi> all the while of the temptation, and pray obſerve where and upon
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93772:113"/> whom did our Saviour charge the guilt of the temptation, was it not upon Satan the tempter, or <hi>Joſhua</hi> the tempted, not a word ſpoken againſt <hi>Joſhua,</hi> but all the blows fell upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, ver. 2. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, the Lord rebuke thee Satan, even the Lord which hath choſen Ieruſalem rebuke thee, is not this a brand pluckt out of the fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be you will ſay, when Chriſt ſtood up ſo much for <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> it was at a time when Chriſt had nothing to accuſe him withall, he had kept his garments pure and unſpotted, but this is not my caſe, I have my filth publickly upon me, my temptations have made me very black and uncomely in his preſence?

For firſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was forced to confeſs that his temptations had made him as black as a brand pluckt out of the fire, and you know when a brand is newly pluckt out of the fire its then a ſad thing to look upon, its then full of ſmoak and filth, apt to ſtain any thing it toucheth. Secondly, he had then at the ſame time very filthy garments upon him, a great deal of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, enough to render him as bad in Chriſts ſight as bad may be, yet all this was buried up in the bowels of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and then why ſhouldſt thou not expect the ſame grace upon coming for it, for all this was to ſhew the carriage of Chriſt to his Church, for <hi>Ioſhua</hi> was but a Figure of the Church then as it was newly come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which came up to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with abundance of pollution cleaving to her; yet Chriſt undertakes with the Father, that in time he will preſent it a more glorious Church, <hi>For he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, before ever he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Diſciples, when after his Reſurrection he ſent them word of his riſing, he ſends not the leaſt hint to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> of his Apoſtaſie, or as if ever ſuch a thing had been, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 17. Again, when he appeared in perſon amongſt the Diſciples, what care did our Saviour take to prevent Saint <hi>Peters</hi> fears, not one ill word could St. <hi>Peter</hi> hear from him, or ill look could St. <hi>Peter</hi> diſcern in him, but all his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes forgotten becauſe all forgiven, infinite compaſſion at work for a weak <hi>Peter,</hi> I have prayed that thy faith fail not, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32.

                  <p>First, Becauſe in his own nature he is faithful, its abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more eaſie for the Sun to ceaſe ſhining then it is for Christ to ceaſe being faithful, therefore in the Revelations the holy Ghost gives him this name, <hi>Rev. 3. 14.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93772:116"/> for them if they would come to him for it.</p>
                  <p>2. Reaſon, why Christ cannot withheld any ſupply of grace from the Lords people, is becauſe of theſe relations he stands in to the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is their friend, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 15. Now a friend is ſo far from withholding what is due, that he will rather add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his own to what was given.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, How ſhould this Qualification of faithfulneſs in Christ ſecure our hope and comfort against falling away totally from grace; Oh how many poor ſouls are there in the world which are under tremblings about this thing, Oh but I fear I may be cast totally out of the grace and favour of God, Oh ſoul, look up to Christ under this doubt, if there be any Interest in heaven to be made against thy falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from a state of grace, thou maist be ſure not to want it: Soul remember, will a poor mortal man (when his Wife stands upon the trial of her life strive, and tug, and labour, by Purſe and Petition, to make an Interest for his Wife, both w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And doth not our Saviour ſay that he is alwayes heard in heaven, <hi>John</hi> 11. 42. Therefore ſaith the Apostle <hi>Heb. 13. 5, 6. So that we may boldly ſay that the Lord is our helper,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93772:116"/> and I will not fear what man can do unto me, for he hath ſaid I will never leave thee nor for ſake thee:</hi> Fear it not, it can never be, if ever he took thee into Covenant, all the Devils in hell can never out thee more, for he takes none into Covenant but ſuch whom he loves, and thoſe whom he begins to love he loves to the end, <hi>John</hi> 13. 1. And its with an everlaſting love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. Its true, a Chriſtian may loſe the ſenſe and ſight of the love of God, many days if not years, But he can never loſe the being of the love of Chriſt to his ſoul; and as much as ſome talk of falling away from grace, thou needſt not trouble thy ſelf much about that point, but leave it to others that can better judge of the thing then thou canſt; beſides, if the notion were rightly underſtood by weak Chriſtians, (<hi>viz.</hi>) about falling from grace, I think there would not be ſo many vain Diſputations, Doubts, and Fears amongſt them about it as there is.</p>
                  <p>Grace in Scripture is taken four manner of ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the ſtate of grace into which a ſoul is placed (through his believing in Chriſt) by an indiſſolvable Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which is never to be violated, or broken, or altered more, <hi>Pſal</hi> 89. 34.

                  <p>Secondly, There is the means of grace, that is all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which God hath provided in his word for the calling home of poor loſt creatures to himſelf, of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks likewiſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are the habits of grace, which are thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpoſitions or qualities of ſanctifying grace, placed in the heart at the time of our Converſion, of which <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 6</p>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93772:117"/> ſo far an Arminian, for our Saviour was of this Judgement, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 19, 20, 21, 22. with <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Of this judgment was St. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 1. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. That men and women may enjoy the means of grace in common with others, and yet have no benefit by it. Again, they may go farther with that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. To have great enlightnings and great taſts of it, and by the powerful convictions of it, made (with <hi>Herod</hi>) to do many good things, but our Saviour tells you that they were ſuch as were never truly rooted, hence it is that the word was never truly rooted in their hearts, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 21. Now to be truly rooted, is elſewhere expounded a rooting in Chriſt by Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Math. 24. 24. Luke 18. 7. Rom. 9. 11. Rom. 11. 5. Peter</hi> 1. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Again, There are the actings, or there is the exerciſe of grace; now in this ſenſe a Child of God may fall from grace, that is, he may go downd the win for a time, he may abate in the degree of his love to, and zele for; and faith in Jeſus Chriſt; Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2, 3. And with <hi>Epheſus, Rev</hi> 2 4. 5.</p>
                  <p>Again, Take grace in the habits of it, now in this ſenſe an Elected, called ſoul can never fall from grace, that is, he can never loſe the roots of his grace more; they may be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up with corruption as the fire is with its aſhes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but it can never be extinguiſht or put out in the ſoul more, but it will now and then appear, as roots may lie many moneths in the Earth unſeen in a Winter ſeaſon, but when the heat of the Sun draws near the Earth they will Spring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſo though grace in the heart may have its Winter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo lie hid under the clods of corruption for a time, when Chriſt the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhall draw near the heart with his heating beams, grace will then ſpring again, <hi>Cant. 1. 12. When the King ſitteth at his Table my ſpicknard ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the ſmell thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will give you one reaſon why grace in the heart can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be wholly extinguiſhed, becauſe its a branch of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93772:117"/> of grace which God hath made with the Elect in Chriſt, <hi>Ier. 31. 33. But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it upon their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Now by that Law in the heart, what can it be but the conveying of the ſanctifying grace of the Covenant into the Souls of the Lords people at the hour and time of their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is grace in the ſtate, or that which we call a ſtate of grace, which is a ſouls being planted into Jeſus Chriſt by faith, from this men and women can never poſſibly fall away; And for theſe three grounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe thoſe that have been really planted into Jeſus Chriſt, they all receive from him eternal life, and Chriſt ſaith, that thoſe which have received from him eternal life, they ſhall never periſh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 28. Now if ſome will aſſert ſuch ſhall periſh or may periſh, and Chriſt ſaith they ſhall not, ſoul I leave thee to believe which of theſe two thou pleaſeſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It cannot be they can fall from grace, becauſe they have Chriſts hand to defend them; now Chriſt is God as well as man, and all power in Heaven and Earth is given into his hand, <hi>Math. 28. 18, Iohn</hi> 10 28.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It cannot be ſo becauſe they are in the Fathers hand, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10 29. They are in the Fathers hand by Electon, and in the Sons by Redemption and Interceſſion, and none can pluck them out of theſe infinite Divine hands; how is it then that ſuch a Doctrine can be true, which ſays that true believers may fall from grace totally and finally.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, this Qualification of faithfulneſs in Chriſt may afford a great deal of comfort in afflicting and perſecuting ſeaſons, let the ſoul meet with never ſo great diſtreſs, he may be ſure to comfort himſelf in the faithfulneſs of Chriſt, though friends may leave him, and an eſtate may leave him, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Iſa. 43 2. When thou paſſeſt thorow the waters I will
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93772:118"/> be with thee, and thorow the Rivers they ſhall not overflow thee, when thou walkeſt thorow the fire thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee:</hi> This the Prophet <hi>David</hi> could experience to be true at ſundry times, who ſaith that Chriſt had been with him in ſix, yea in ſeven troubles, who doth inſtance in ſome of his troubles, how he had found Chriſt with him in theſe troubles one was this, when his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left hm, then the Lord took him up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 10. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this, when his friends and acquaintance had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from him and did look ſtrange upon him, the Lord ſtood by him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 11. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay likewiſe, when all men forſook him, yet the Lord ſtood by him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16, 17. And therefore would comfort the diſtreſſed <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor. 10 13. That though no temptation had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them, but what was common to Saints, yet Chriſt was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who would not ſuffer them to be tempted above what they were able to bear, and would with the temptation make away for their eſcape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſpeak this by experience, for he had found it ſo; Oh therefore live upon the faithfulneſs of Chriſt in a Gaol, in a Dungeon, any where, for he hath ſaid he will never leave thee nor forſake thee; if thou art ſick he will make thy bed in thy ſickneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 3. If thou art poor he will ſtick cloſer to thee then a Brother, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18 24. If thou art tempted, it ſhall be in his arms, <hi>Heb. 2. 18. For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour thoſe which are tempted:</hi> In a word, he is ſo faithful as to bear a part with thee in all thy afflictions let them be what they will, <hi>Iſa. 63. 9. In all their afflictions he is afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them:</hi> Oh therefore make him thy High Prieſt, live upon him for thee and thine in all conditions whatſoever, intruſt him with thy ſoul, with thy body, with thy relations, with thy eſtate, with thy all, for he is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true witneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 14.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP 30.</hi> The Conſecrated Garments of the High Prieſt, in which he was to Minister for the people.</head>
               <p>THe High Preiſts garments were twofold, there was what was proper to his body, from the neck downward to the feet; and ſecondly there was what was proper to the head of the High Prieſt from the neck upwards.</p>
               <p>Now in the garments which were proper to the body of the High Prieſt, from the neck downward, there were theſe things conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The long Robe it ſelf, which covered the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the High Prieſt from the neck down to the feet, we find it to be a very glorious thing as it will appear if we conſider the matter of which it was made, which was of Gold, blue Purple, and Scarlet, and fine Linen, <hi>Exod</hi> 27 4, 5. This ſhews us, or ſets forth to us, the glorious Robe of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in which Believers only ſtand juſtified before God. The body of the High Prieſt when clothed with his Prieſtly garments, held out two things to an eye of faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The head with its Crown and Miter upon it, that held out Chriſt as the head of his Church, therefore that had the Miter and the Crown upon it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The whole body of the Prieſt below the head, that ſignified the whole Church of Chriſt, over whom Chriſt is head: Now as the body of the Prieſt was wholly covered over (in all the parts of it) with this glorious long Robe, ſo it ſhews us how the whole body of the Elect ſtand covered over with Chriſts Righteouſneſs before God, in which alone they are in perſon and performance preſented complete be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93772:119"/> God: Therefore when the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of the Elects meeting in Chriſt, and covered over with this glorious Robe of Righteouſneſs, ſaith in <hi>Col. 2. 10. And ye are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in him which is the head of all Principalities and Powers:</hi> That is, when Believers have by faith put on the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt about them (as the High Prieſt did put on his garments) then are they complete in Gods ſight, and not till then. Hence it is when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the work of making Chriſt ours, he delivered himſelf in ſuch phraſes as hold analogy with the High Prieſts putting on his long Robe, that you may know the one was a Type of the other: As in <hi>Rom. 13. 14. But ye put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo Eph. 4. 24. <hi>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs:</hi> ſo Phil. 3. 9. <hi>And be found in him not having mine own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law:</hi> That is, to put him on as a Robe, or to be found in him or his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, wholly covered over with it by faith as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how the Scriptures make the High Prieſts garments, and the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, to agree and harmonize together.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Uſe 1.</head>
                  <p>Then this ſhews us the uſefulneſs of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, or Chriſts Righteouſneſs; ſoul know this, that there is no covering will either protect thee from the wrath of God, or preſent thee or thy duties acceptable with God, but this covering; ſhouldſt thou make up a covering of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt duties or works of Righteouſneſs that ever was ſpun by the fineſt Phariſee in the world, it would prove but rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before the Lord; alas my friends, if God had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided <hi>Adam</hi> better coverings then his Fig-leave Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what had there become of <hi>Adam,</hi> and all us in him. There is nothing will or can cover thy nakedneſs but this Righteouſneſs, your ſpots will ſtill appear and ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93772:119"/> do what you can; you were as good go about to build a ſhip of Paper to ſail through the Ocean withall, as to think to ſail to heaven in a veſſel of your own Righteouſneſs. If you will accept of this Righteouſneſs, well, if not, God will accept of no other from you; this is of Gods providing for you if you like it, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God will like nothing but what is of his own making, bring him what you will for Righteouſneſs except this of Chriſts, certainly the everlaſting burnings will quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it into aſhes, and peirce through all: Therefore labour to get into this righteouſneſs, beg hard for it, that thou maiſt be preſented to God without ſpot or blemiſh; its for the ſake of this that the Church is ſo glorious in Gods eye, <hi>Cant. 4 9. Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my Siſter my Spouſe, thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thy eyes, with one chain of thy neck:</hi> So Cant 1. 15. <hi>Behold thou art fair my love, behold thou art fair, thou haſt doves eyes, and</hi> Cant. 4. 7. <hi>Behold thon art all fair my love, there is no ſpot in thee.</hi> All this is ſpoken with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is upon the Church of Chriſt; this was the Churches great ground of joy and rejoycing, not that ſhe was clothed with the glory of the world, but with the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Iſa. 61. 10. I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my ſoul ſhall be joyful in my God, for he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation, and hath covered me with the Robe of his righteouſneſs, as a Bridegroom decketh himſelf with ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth her ſelf with Jewels:</hi> Certainly ſad is the condition of theſe men and women which have left this bleſſed righteous covering, upon what ſpecious pretence ſoever; it may be they think they have found out a better way for their juſtification before God; they think they can provide God a better Robe, a Garment made up of their juſt dealing with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, adding to it their outward abſtination from ſome meats, and drink, and ſuperfluity in apparel, together with
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93772:120"/> ſome endeavours to act up to a light within them; Oh this they hug, and embrace, and cry up as the only glorious righteouſneſs, crying out, lo here is Chriſt, he dwells in this light we cry up, he lives in this Robe of righteouſneſs which we have ſpun, come turn to it and hear, incline your ears and your ſouls ſhall live; thus poor blinded (yet very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) ſouls, they are juſt as the Jews were, carried out by the Devil (being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs) to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of their own in oppoſition to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3.</p>
                  <p>Dear friends, have a care of parting with that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is only juſtifying before God, and I do affirm that there is nothing within a man that will juſtifie him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, there is no light in any man on earth can or will do it, take it either for a natural or divine light, and that ſoul that ſhall make any thing within him a ground for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in oppoſition to this Robe of righteouſneſs, I ſay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the voice of Scripture, cannot be ſaved if he lives and dies in that errour; St. <hi>Paul</hi> and theſe perſons who are for a righteouſneſs within them (for juſtification) were of a vaſt differing judgment; theſe (which are faln from the righteouſneſs of faith) ſay, for their parts they will have a righteouſneſs found in themſelves which ſhall juſtifie them; but S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he deſires that himſelf may be found in that righteouſneſs which ſhall juſtifie him before God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 9.

                  <hi>CHAP. 31.</hi> I next come to ſpeak of theſe Myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things which belonged to the Robe or Garment which the High Prieſt did wear about him when he was to adminiſter (for the people) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,</head>
               <p>FIrſt there was a breſt-plate made for the Robe, made of a plate of Gold four-ſquare, in breadth and length about a ſpan every way, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 9.</p>
               <p>In this breſt-plate of Gold there was engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Iſrael, in Letters ſet in rows, with precious ſtones, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 10, 11, 12, 13. 14. There was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſet in this breſt-place the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, Exod.</hi> 28 30.</p>
               <p>This plate was tied about the High Prieſts long Robe with chains of Gold, that ſo the plate (which had the names of the twelve tribes written in it) might ſet ſtrait upon the High Prieſts heart, <hi>Exod</hi> 39 19, 20, 21. with <hi>Exod</hi> 28 29, 30.</p>
               <p>The uſe and purpoſe of this breſt-plate, was to ſhew all believers (for their great Conſolation) theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Concerning the deep ſenſe that Chriſt hath of the ſeveral conditions, that his people are liable unto in this world; for you ſee that the names of the twelve tribes were written upon this breſt-plate, which was placed upon the High Prieſts heart.</p>
               <p>Now by the names of the twelve tribes in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 29. We are not to underſtand preciſely of the Iſraelites, but more
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93772:121"/> generally of the whole body of the Elect, both of Jews and Gentiles, as elſewhere it is ſo underſtood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Now all the names of the body of the Elect, was the High Preiſt to carry upon his heart, <hi>Exod. 28. 29. And Aaron ſhall bear the names of the Children of Iſrael in the breſt-plate of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his heart, when he goeth into the holy place for a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al before the Lord continually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay it ſhews us how deeply the ſeveral conditions of the Elect are ſtamped upon the heart of Chriſt, he bears them all upon his heart, he keeps to this day (though in glory) a naked place in his heart to affect himſelf with his peoples conditions, ſaith <hi>David, Pſal. 40. 5. Many O Lord are thy wonderous works which thou haſt done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward, they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee, I would declare and ſpeak of them, they are more then can be numbred,</hi> ſo Jer. 29 11. <hi>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed end,</hi> ſo that you may perceive how the Scripture doth make the High Prieſts carrying the names of the Children of Iſrael upon his breſt-plate, and Chriſt our great High Prieſt carrying the whole of the conditions of his Church upon his heart now in heaven, to agree and ſimbolize.</p>

Aſſure thy ſelf all this lives upon the heart of Chriſt now in glory, that he might be deeply affected with theſe conditions which this world affords his people, O read that bleſſed place in <hi>Heb. 2. 17. Wherefore it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a merciful High Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make Reconciliation for the ſins of the people, for in that himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour thoſe that are tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>This leads me to a ſecond thing about the breſt-place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the High Prieſts heart, which was this, The Prieſt was to carry the names of the Children of Iſrael (written upon the breſt-plate) before the Lord; which ſhews us that Chriſt doth not (as he is our High Prieſt) only carry the ſenſe of Believers conditions upon his heart, but it ſeems it is to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93772:122"/> good purpoſe, for he carrieth them in before the Lord, <hi>Exod. 28. 29. And Aaron ſhall bear the names of the Children of Iſrael in the breſt-plate of judgment upon his heart when he goeth into the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may ask me, what comfort will that afford a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever that Chriſt was to carry their conditions before the Lord?</p>
                  <p>Anſwer, O there is much in this Myſtery, and that in point of prevalency with God, who is the great Lord of all the bleſſings that Believers do enjoy, for there is not any ſpecial favour which comes from Chriſt to a Believer, but Chriſt firſt draws it forth from the Father, <hi>Iames 1. 17. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the father of lights.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all this in the Type is to aſſure the Believer, that without doubt (if he hath hung up his condition upon the heart of Chriſt) it muſt go well with it in heaven, for God the Father is merciful enough in himſelf (for he is called the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and one in whom the fatherleſs findeth mercy, ſo that there is an aptneſs and readineſs in God himſelf upon the knowledge of his peoples conditions, to give out relief and ſupply to them; O but when the wants, neceſſities, miſeries and afflctions, trials and temptationss, ſhall be brought in before God by a High Prieſt, one who was conſtituted and appointed by the Father for this very end, this muſt needs be effectual, otherwiſe God will render his work in the High Prieſt of no effect, but God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made or ſet up any thing in vain, but the ſitting of the High Prieſt was Gods own act and ancient contrivance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 1.</p>
                  <p>And the Prieſt was appointed on purpoſe by the Lord for this piece of work (amongſt the reſt) to produce the ſeveral conditions of his people before him in order to a ſupply; ſurely this muſt amount to ſomething on which Believers may depend for comfort; but beſides, if we do but mind
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93772:122"/> what the High Prieſt was to do when he was to carry the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conditions of the people before the Lord, it will ſtill add to our comfort; and that was this, he was in the ſame place to pour out ſtrong cries to God, that he would both look upon and take into deep conſideration the Eſtates of the people, now brought into his preſence, and that by a High Prieſt, a man in office, choſen by himſelf for the purpoſe to bear the names of the whole Iſrael of God before the Lord in order to ſupply.</p>
                  <p>Surely this muſt prevail in heaven, for if the Lord was ſo ready to be moved with compaſſion at the cries of an <hi>Iſhmael, Gen.</hi> 21. 17. Surely much more will God hear the cries of a High Prieſt, who hath the anointings upon him, to make him every way prevailing upon the heart of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 7.</p>
                  <p>Surely methinks this ſhould very much encourage Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to wait upon God in dark times for ſupplies; beſides, when this High Prieſt ſhall be the Son of God, yea his only Son, brought up with him from eternity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8 23.</p>
                  <p>And when the Father ſhall ſee that Jeſus Chriſt his Son brings in the wants, diſtreſſes, temptations, afflictions of his people upon his heart, giving aſſurance thereby that he hath made their conditions, all of them his own, for they live upon and in, the heart of Jeſus Chriſt, as that their wants are his wants, their pains are his pains, and temptations his temptations, for he ſympathyzeth with them in all reſpects, <hi>Iſa. 63 9. In all their afflictions he is afflicted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when he ſhall add to it, his ſtrong cries and tears poured forth with deep ſighs and groans, crying out, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe are all of my body for whom I intercede, if thou loveſt me, have regard to their conditions, they are my own fleſh and bones, in helping them and relieving them, and eaſing them out of pain, thou relieveſt me, and helpeſt me, and eaſeſt me out of pain, for in all their afflictions I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; Therefore I pray thee let the Angel of thy preſence ſave them; Lord look upon my heart, and here thou ſhalt ſee the names of the twelve tribes (even all my Iſrael) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93772:123"/> in the Letters of my own blood, thou ſhalt never ſee thy Son but with their conditions engraven upon his heart: And what think you ſouls, will not this prevail, may not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſafely adventure their all upon the work of this Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; Oh ſtudy this more, and your comfort will be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome may ſay, it may be thought the High Prieſt under the Law did do ſo for the people, I mean, carry their names upon his heart before the Lord, yet its a queſtion whether Chriſt doth do this always now he is in heaven; Is always, for ſo much as this lieth in the Type, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28 29. The Prieſt was to bear the names of the people upon his heart for a Memorial before the Lord continually, which ſheweth that this Prieſthood piece of ſervice, of bearing the names of the people before the Lord, was to continue for ever; for it was to be a Memorial before the Lord conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; not only was this work of the High Prieſt in the Type to remain for a for ever, ſo long as there will be any need of Chriſts Interceſſion, but always for ever, for ſo the word continually) doth likewiſe import, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 7. 24. But this man, becauſe he continueth ever, hath a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to make Interceſſion for them;</hi> ſo that we may ſafely ſay that Chriſt our High Prieſt is always in heaven lifting up holy hands (as it were) to God for Believers, in a way of preſenting their conditions before him; whether thou ſleepeſt or wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, whether thou art able to pray or not, yet Chriſt is at prayer for thee, he intercedes night at day for thy welfare, <hi>He ever liveth to make Interceſſion for thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is that <hi>David</hi> could ſo comfortably lie down in his bed and take his reſt ſo ſecurely by night, he knew that Chriſt had his condition upon his heart, <hi>Pſalm 4. 8. I will both lay me down to ſleep, for the Lord only maketh me rest in ſafety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We may learn this from it, that the High Prieſts going into the preſence of the Lord with the names of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93772:123"/> twelve tribes upon his heart, it ſhews u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that Chriſt enters he preſence of the Father in the names of all true Believers Chriſt doth it for them, and intercedes for them in their name, as well as for their ſake; As the High Prieſt under the Law was choſen for the people, ſo Chriſt was ſent forth to agitate for Believers, and tells the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it were that he is come to him in the form of a ſervant, to diſcharge his duty to God for Believers. If I pray, Petition, intercede, for any ſpiritual mercy for them, it is but to fulfil thy will (in this caſe) from eternity, for this was the great deſign that thou hadſt before the world was, that I ſhould come down from glory, and take upon me the form of a ſervant, and die the bitter death of the Croſs, that the Elect might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and then to go up to glory again on purpoſe to make Interceſſion for them; and therefore if I ask any ſpiritual favour for them, its no more then I was appointed to do by thee from everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>Oh what a deal of comfort may a poor ſoul draw from this conſideration, of the breſt-plates being upon the High Prieſts heart, wherein the names of the Elect of God are engraven.</p>
                  <p>Oh methinks if a ſoul were aſſured he were upon no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies heart in the world, either Husbands heart, Wives heart, Fathers heart, Mothers heart, Brothers heart, Siſters heart, Friends or Neighbours heart, yet to be in ſo eminent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upon Chriſts heart, this is enough to bear up the ſoul in the worſt of times.</p>
                  <p>There was likewiſe placed in the breſt-plate the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, Exod.</hi> 28. 30. This of the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was to be underſtood two ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As it had relation to the Type it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>2. As it related to the Anti-type, which was Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As it related to the Type it ſelf, which was the High Prieſt called to office, a principal part of whoſe office it was to teach and inſtruct the people in the Doctrine of God, as to the Worſhip and Service of him; its true, there were others
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93772:124"/> of the inferiour Prieſts did this work of expounding to, and teaching the people alſo, but the High Prieſt was not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this great duty, <hi>Mal. 2. 7. The Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth, for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> did ſignifie thoſe two qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to be in the Prieſt, was which the ſoundneſs of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he was to deliver to the people, and the holineſs of his life as a pattern and example amongſt them; the Prieſt was to preach to or preſs upon the Conſciences of the people, nothing elſe but the ſound ſubſtantial truths of God, not his own novels or brainiſh fancies or dreams, but the wholſome Doctrine of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 17. (ſaith God) <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a watch-man unto the houſe of Iſrael, therefore hear the word of my mouth, and give them warning from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh what care ſhould the Miniſters of the Lord take in this matter, that they feed the flock of God with ſound and wholſome food, therefore is the exhortation from St. <hi>Peter</hi> to all the Miniſters of the word in the world, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 11. If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its true, there are many men paſſing under the name of Miniſters of Chriſt now a days in the world, but how few of them make it their faithful and painful labours in their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to bring forth pure truth; but on the contrary, wreſt it and ſtretch it, and puts it upon a rack to make it bend every way to ſerve their ungodly wicked ends and purpoſes; And ſo inſtead of feeding the flock of God (which was purchaſed with his own blood) with ſound wholſome food, they feed them with Gall and Wormwood, who rather pervert then convert any they have to do withall.</p>
                  <p>Take the moſt ſober ſort of them, I mean, the moſt Idle and Laze ſort, ſuch who love neither to feed the fold of Chriſt either with Gall, or Honey, that is, as the Prophet ſpeaks, they are dumb dogs, ſuch as will not bark, lying down, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ſlumber, yet they can feed themſelves with the fat
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93772:124"/> and the ſweet, and cloth themſelves with the wooll: But for the fatneſs of ſound Doctrine and the ſweetneſs of truth, the Church of God may periſh, and rot, and die, for any thing they eare or are thoughtful about, ſurely the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> was never upon the breaſts of theſe ſacred Prieſts, as they would be owned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As for the other qualification which is holineſs of life and converſation, this ought to be in and upon the Miniſters of the Lord; They ought to be exemplary in their lives and converſations for others to imitate them, that ſo they might not build for God with one hand, and throw it down again with the other hand, this is our Saviours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to all Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>Math. 5. 16. Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they ſeeing your good works, might glorifie your Father which is in heaven,</hi> therefore ſaith St. <hi>Peter, 1 Pet. 2. 5, 3. Neither as being Lords over Gods heritage, but being enſamples to the flock.</hi>

                  <head>Uſe 2.</head>
                  <p>O Then how unhappy are the people of ſome Countries in the World, with reſpect to the want of this great qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Miniſters, or pretended ſuch how; hard a thing is it to find the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> upon their Prieſts, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks to ſee men and meet men with their loins girt ſo ſeemingly devout, and yet to ſee theſe casks ſo empty either of ſound Doctrine or a holy Converſation, it is to me a piece of unparallel'd hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>Its known to all that know any thing, that the generallity of the world, are apter to walk by examples then by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; the Authority of precepts depends very much upon the good lives of thoſe which preach them; alas Brethren, what is it if a man go into a Pulpit and preach a very good Learned Sermon, and as ſoon as he is come forth of the place to ſpend the reſt of the Sabbath with his Pariſhioners in an Alchouſe, it may be untill they are all drunk in the place, or
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:93772:125"/> to ſome ungodly ſport or other, to the very ſhame of nature it ſelf, if their be any Bull-baiting or Bear-baiting, any Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Wreſtling, or Cudgel-playing, any Crowding, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, May-pole, or Church Ale-gaming, who more fritcher and forwarder in the work then the Parſon of the Pariſh.</p>
                  <p>Thus the poor people are made Sermon proof, and ſhut up againſt all convictions of truth, through the ſcandalous converſations of their idle profane Prieſts, which they have amongſt them; how far are ſuch from being the Prieſts of the Lord, bearing the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> upon their breſts, let the world Judge.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Where as its ſaid that the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was written in the breſt-plate, and placed upon his heart; it ſhews us how much the work ſhould be upon his ſpirit that the Prieſt doth for God, and how near he ſhould ſet it to his heart, ſo ſhould it be with all the Miniſters of the Goſpel, they ought to ſet thoſe truths which they preach very near their hearts, yea, ſuch as are true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, they do ſet thoſe truths which they preach to others neareſt their hearts of any thing in the world, God hath ordered it that it ſhall be ſo, he gives them (that he ſends forth as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) the little Book of truth to eat into their bowels, that it might live in their hearts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 9</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tells you that the word of God lived in his heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20 9.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>David</hi> a Prophet of the Lord, alſo could tell you that the word of God and the truths he was to deliver, were dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to him then thouſands of Gold or Silver, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 72. The Lord makes it ſo to them, that they may take delight in the preaching of it.</p>
                  <p>2. That they may be careful of corrupting of it, you know things that are dear and near our hearts we are very apt to keep pure, but ſuch things as we regard not we throw into any hole, ſo that it eaſily corrupts and ruſts.</p>
                  <p>3. That if need be they may lay down their lives in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it; this it was made St. <hi>Paul</hi> cry out he was not only
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:93772:125"/> ready to be bound, but to die in the defence of truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. It was the nearneſs of truth to his heart, but how few of them are there in the world that call themſelves Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that in any ſenſe wears the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> upon their hearts.</p>
                  <p>2. As this qualification did relate to the Type which was the High Prieſt, and ſo in him all the ſucceeding Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſo it relates to Chriſt who was the Anti-type of it: And ſo the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> ſhews us theſe two great things (for our comfort) which are infinitely to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The infinite perfection of holineſs and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in Chriſt, <hi>John 1. 14. He was full of grace and truth, Col. 1. 19. For it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell;</hi> This teacheth us theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>1. What believers are in the ſight of God through Chriſt, a people full of holineſs, for Chriſt is the Vine, and believers the Branches; now by vertue of this union God looks upon all alike, God in the wiſe diſpenſations of his grace hath ſo ordered it, that believers and his Son ſhall make up but one body, that ſo God might account for the Heads ſake all the members holy, not that they are ſo in themſelves, but I ſay God is pleaſed to account it ſo, that believers are as holy as his Son, they being of him and in him, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. For he was made ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And God would have us to reckon ſo too for our comfort, mark that place in <hi>Rom. 6. 11. Likewiſe reckon your ſelves to be alſo dead indeed unto ſin, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> There is not any man in the world dead to ſin or perfectly alive towards God; its true, the Saints are a dying to ſin daily, and a labouring out after life towards God, ſaith St. <hi>Paul, I preſs hard after the mark, Phil</hi> 3. 14. But for any to ſay he is perfectly dead to ſin, and perfectly alive to God, in himſelf, he ſaith not the truth, I ſpeak of perfection in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; yet you ſee God would have believers look upon
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93772:126"/> themſelves ſo, reckon it to be ſo ſaith God, that is, as they are in Chriſt and by the Father there apprehended, for Chriſt was ſo in himſelf fully, yet not for himſelf but for believers, read 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. He was made of God Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It informs the Saints from whom they do derive their holineſs and ſanctification, and to whom they ſhould go for it.</p>
                  <p>O friends, you drive it all from Jeſus Chriſt, he is the fountain of all your grace of holineſs and ſanctification, <hi>John 1. 14, 16, 17. The word was made fleſh, and it dwelt amongst us, and we beheld his glory, as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, and of his fullneſs have we all received, and grace for grace,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>For the Law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is called the head of the body, <hi>Eph</hi> 5 Whoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is to give down his ſupplies to the ſeveral members of the ſame, for the mutual benefit of the whole body.</p>
                  <p>There was a ſtock of grace and holineſs laid into Chriſt for this very purpoſe, therefore is Chriſt called the Saints trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury or ſtore-houſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. So ſaith our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Iohn 17. 19. For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they all might be ſanctified through the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O therefore ſouls! make to Chriſt for grace and holineſs, remember the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thimmim</hi> of all; perfection both of Doctrine and holineſs of life, lieth in Jeſus Chriſt, on purpoſe to be given out to thoſe that come for it.</p>
                  <p>Here it was <hi>David</hi> fled for ſanctification under the decays of grace, <hi>Pſal. 51. 7, 10. Purge me with hyſop and I ſhall be clean, waſh me and I ſhall be whiter then ſnow,</hi> Pſal. 36. 9. <hi>For with thee is the Fonntain of life, and in thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soul, doſt thou want grace, purging grace, ſanctifying grace, wouldſt thou be more holy in thy life and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then thou heareſt where the fountain is, make out to him, its his deſire to have thee come, thou canſt not pleaſe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93772:126"/> him in any thing better, then to ſue to him for grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink,</hi> John 7. 37. <hi>Therefore come with boldneſs to the throne of grace to ask grace and mercy to help in time of need, Heb.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We may draw out this (from the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> upon the Prieſts heart) for our comfort to help us in dark erronious times.</p>
                  <p>When the Doctrines of the Scripture are by men corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that we cannot drink them any where, ſhould we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel from Sea to Sea, there is not a Prieſt or Miniſter that ſtands up in the defence of truth, but every one perverts and corrupts it; I ſay, ſhould we fall into ſuch a ſeaſon, that we cannot find a Miniſter with the <hi>Urim</hi> or <hi>Thummim</hi> upon his breaſt; yet we may comfort our ſelves in this, that our High Prieſt in heaven is not corrupted, he hath the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> ſtill as much upon his heart as ever, who taketh care to feed his people with ſound Doctrine and with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food; however it goes amongſt the Prieſts here below, yet this Prieſts lips ſhall preſerve knowledge, if you will ſeek the Law at his mouth, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. In the greateſt darkneſs that over-ſpread <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet he provided a light for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Goſhen, Exod.</hi> 10. 23. So when the Anti-chriſtian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſpread the Roman Empire all over, yet Chriſt took care that his people ſhould have a place of nouriſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14. So in the times of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, when all the ſhepherds were corrupted in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they had trodden down the good paſture of truth and juſtice both in Church and State, and had fould the remainders of it with their feet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 18, 19. Yet then ſee the care of this Goſpel High Prieſt in thoſe times, that although others did periſh for want of ſound wholſome ſoul-food, yet his people ſhould be fed from himſelf with the fineſt of Wheat and Oil, read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 11, 12, 13, 14</p>
                  <p>O therefore make uſe of Chriſt upon this account, let him be your ſtay, let errour fill all the publick places in the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93772:127"/> world, yet thy High Prieſt will provide for the ſincere though in holes and corners, <hi>I will ſend you the Comforter</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and he ſhall teach you all things,</hi> John 14. 26.</p>
                  <p>Men may ſhut up all thy ſound Miniſters from thy ſoul, ſuch who have fed thee with knowledge and underſtanding, but be of good comfort, they can never ſhut up from thee this Goſpel teaching Spirit, this will give thy heart a viſit in the moſt ſecret places of the earth, this was with the Spouſe in the ſecret places of the ſtairs, and in the clefts of the Rocks, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. This ſoul teaching Agent is not ſtraitned, ſaith our Saviour its like the wind it bloweth where it liſteth, men may hear the ſonnd of it, but cannot tell from whence it comes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>There was likewiſe at the hem of this glorious Robe tied ſeveral Bells and Pomgranates, a Bell and a Pomgranate, a Bell and a Pomgranate, round about the hem of the Robe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 25, 26, with <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 35.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe of this may be ſeveral ways conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It was for noiſe or ſound, when the Prieſt was to enter before the Lord, for this purpoſe was the Bells, for it would have coſt the Prieſt his life, if he ſhould have gone in to the preſence of the Lord without theſe Bells ringing at the hem of his Robe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 35.</p>
                  <p>Here we ſee what little regard God hath to theſe ſilent Meetings in Worſhip, as the Quakers and others dream of; God loves a laudable ſound in his Worſhip, <hi>Aarons</hi> Bells were to make a ſound in the Woſhip of God: But ſome may ſay is God taken with Words and Voices?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, would not the ſame Objection have quarrelled with <hi>Aarons</hi> Bells; would one think God ſhould be taken with the ringing of a company of Bells in his Worſhip; friends, have a care you be not ſuch as would be wiſer then God, let us keep cloſe to the known rule of Worſhip, if we cannot give a reaſon why we ſhould do this, or that, or the other thing in the Worſhip of God; let us remember God can.</p>
                  <p>And for the Saints meeting together, in Scripture I find
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93772:127"/> it was to ſpeak often one to another, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther private Meeting, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 19. But our Saviour comes and ſpeaks or preacheth a word of peace to them, and in ver. 26. Another private Meeting, but our Saviour by his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing keeps it from being a ſilent one; Another private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held in <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 13, 14. Where they continued in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bread and in prayer, but never read of any ſuch ſilent meetings as the Quakers keep, ſo likewiſe if we conſider the exhortations which the Scripture gives to the Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their meeting together, we find it was to provoke one another to love and good works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 24 25.</p>
                  <p>And that ſhould ſpend the time away in their building up of one another in their moſt holy faith, and praying together in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Iude</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>Now can this be done where there is nothing but ſilence, will ſitting an hour or two together, only looking in the ground in our meetings, fulfil theſe exhortations.</p>
                  <p>Alas Brethren, God will be ſerved with whole man, ſoul and body, the body as well as the ſoul, for God made both for his glory, and Chriſt Redeemed both for the Worſhip of God; And upon this account we are bid to glorifie God with our bodies as well as with our ſouls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. And we are exhorted to preſent God with our whole bodies as well as our ſouls in the Worſhip of God, as living ſacrifices, which is but our reſonable ſervice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſaith <hi>David, My tongue ſhall be as the Pen of a ready Writer, Pſ.</hi> 45. 1. He would make uſe of his tongue in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God to praiſe him withall: So <hi>Pſal. 71. 24. My tongue ſhall talk of thy righteouſneſs all the day long,</hi> Pſal. 27. 7. Pſ 28 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome will ſay, the Scripture ſaith that bodily exerciſe profiteth little.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, not bodily exerciſe uſed in the worſhip of God excluded; but bodily exerciſe when the ſoul is excluded out of the worſhip of God, this ſigniſies but little in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, elſe why did the Apoſtle exhort the <hi>Romans</hi> to give up the body as well as the ſoul to God in his ſervice, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:93772:128"/>
                  <p>But ſecondly, the gingling of <hi>Aarons</hi> Bells did ſignifie the laudable ſound that the Prieſts Doctrine was to make in the ears of the people, he was not to be a dumb ſilent Miniſter, but to make his Doctrine to ring (for God) in the ears of the people, you may ſee the Charge which is given in this caſe to Miniſters, <hi>Iſa 58. 1. Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of Iacob their ſins.</hi>

                  <p>O how few <hi>Aaronites</hi> can we ſee or hear now in the world, how ſeldom can the poor people hear the ringing of the Bells of ſound Doctrine in their ears, in ſome Pariſhes not above once a moneth, in ſo much, that the poor people have almoſt forgot that kind of Muſick; and as for others when they do ring the <hi>Aaronite</hi> Bells of Doctrine to the people, its ſo much confounded with the ſound of other mixt Bells which they have added to them, that when the Miniſter rings them, the people can hardly tell whether they be rung in <hi>England</hi> or in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Bells of <hi>Aarons</hi> garment did ſignifie the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, forwardneſs, and aptneſs which there ſhould be in the Prieſt to the work which God called him unto, he was not to be hauld and dragged to his work, he was to act readily from a principle of willingneſs, you may conceive the Bells at the end of the long Robe, would gingle with every little motion of the body, ſo ſhould Miniſters readily, freely, and willingly give out the mind of God to the dark blind world; this is ſo in a great meaſure found upon the Miniſters of Chriſt, that have the <hi>Aaronite</hi> Bells upon their garments, read that noble paſſage of the Apoſtle in <hi>Acts 3. 6. Silver and Gold have I none, but ſuch as I have give I thee, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt of Nazareth riſe up and walk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples when he ſent them forth to preach the Goſpel to the world, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 8.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93772:128"/> 
                     <hi>Freely have you received, therefore freely give.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God abhors a lazie idle Preacher, they are the worſt plants that ſtands in his Vineyard; an idle Miniſter will quickly grow an ignorant Miniſter, for ſo the Lord puts them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Iſa 56. 10.

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore when the Apoſtle would give a true Character of an <hi>Aaronite</hi> indeed, one that carryeth the <hi>Aaronite</hi> Bells to the hem of his garment, he tells you in 2 <hi>Tim. 2 24. He ſhould be apt to teach,</hi> that is, ready, willing, or forward in his work, one that need not be puld to it with Cart-ropes, that acts from a principle of love to, and delight in his work, ſaith St. <hi>Paul, A Diſpenſation is committed to me, and wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Of Lamentation, O how few of ſuch Miniſters do the Earth abound with at this time, that are apt to teach the Goſpel to the poor world, yea they are ſo far from being apt to this work themſelves, that they labour to ſtop up the way againſt others, who out of Conſcience to their duty (though at a low rate) would do the work themſelves, but muſt ſtand by as uſeleſs and can do nothing: The good Lord Judge between party and party in this matter, if it be thy bleſſed will; how many poor ſouls lies now a periſhing through this dreadful evil, is notorious known to many Countries, though not ſo much laid to heart, and bewailed before the Lord as the matter requireth.</p>
                  <p>Again, There were Pomgranates likewiſe mixed with the Bells at the hem of the long Robe. Now the Pomgranates with the Bells, did ſet forth the glory of the doctrine of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93772:129"/> Goſpel; for the colour of the Pomgranates was very glorious, as you may ſee, if you read their complexion in <hi>Exo.</hi> 28. 33. for they were to be made of sky colour Purple, and of Scarlet: but the Pomgranate alone did ſet forth to us the fatneſs and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment which the Goſpel doth afford the ſouls of Believers that live upon the Goſpel; for ſo is the Pomgranate ſet forth in the Scripture to be a very pleaſant feeding fruit, <hi>Canticles</hi> 4 13. O ſo is the Goſpel, its fatneſs it ſelf is called a feaſt of marrow, and fat things, of Wine well refined upon the Lees, as you have it in <hi>Iſa</hi> 25. 6.</p>
                  <p>O this is the refreſhing, ſatisfying, fatning, good in the world. O the Goſpel, what a choice thing is it to the ſouls of the Lords people, which makes them cry out, bread and the Goſpel is good fare. A gracious ſoul knows no ſuch feaſting as preaching; no ſuch fatneſs as the word of God brings forth to them: the love of which have made ſome to throw up all their Eſtates and good things in this life to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it.</p>
                  <p>This made the Apoſtle kick up their fiſhing Trade, and this made <hi>Matthew</hi> to leave his great place in the Cuſtom-Office, and <hi>Zacheus</hi> to throw up the half of his Eſtate to the poor; O they ſaw by an eye of faith a better glory in the colour of the Pomgranate, truth of the Tabernacle, they had heard better Muſick in the Bells of the Prieſthood, and had taſted more fatneſs in the juice of the Pomgranate Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of grace and Reconciliation with the Father by the blood of Chriſt, then in all the pleaſant Muſicks, glories, or rareſt feeding dainties which this world could afford them, could it give me ten thouſand times as much again as its able.</p>
                  <p>O ſaith <hi>David</hi> (whoſe Court abounded with all worldly pleaſures and delights) the greateſt fatneſs lieth in the houſe of God, <hi>Pſal 36. 8. They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the Rivers of thy pleaſures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for all his Kingdom-glory here below in all the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:93772:129"/> and fatneſs of it, yet upon the account of theſe taſtes which he had had of the far exceeding fatneſs, and richneſs, and ſweetneſs he found in the Pomgranate truths of the houſe of God, he doth proteſt in the <hi>Pſal. 84. 10. That one day in the Courts of the Lord were better then a thouſand, and that he had rather be a Door-keeper in the houſe of God, then to dwell in the tents of wickedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was likewiſe a glorious girdle made for the Prieſt, which was wrought with Purple Blue and Scarlet, fine twined Linen, this the Prieſt was to wear about his loins, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 5. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 5. This girdle of the High Prieſt doth hold forth theſe things to our conſideration; the girding up of the loins doth import theſe things to us.</p>
                  <p>1. It denotes the reſolution of the will to action, <hi>Jer. 1. 17. Thou therefore gird up thy loins and ariſe, and speak unto them all that I command thee, be not diſmayed at their faces, least I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thee before them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Sometimes it denotes the ſtrength which God gives to his ſervants, by which means they are enabled to perform that work he imploys them about, <hi>Pſal. 18. 39. For thou gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me with ſtrength unto the battel, thou ſubdueſt under me thoſe that roſe up againſt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Sometimes its put down in Scripture to denote the ſincerity and faithfulneſs of the mind in the work a man ſets about, <hi>Eph. 6. 14. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all theſe conſiderations (about the girding of the loins) do all agree unto and meet together in the Golden girdle of our Goſpel High Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, let me ſhew you that Jeſus Chriſt, our Goſpel High Prieſt, is ſet forth to you as the Anti type of the legal High Prieſt, with reſpect to the garments which the High Prieſt was to wear, and amongſt which this of the Golden girdle is not omitted, in <hi>Dan. 10. 5. 6. Then I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whoſe loins were girded about with a Golden girdle, his body alſo was like the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:93772:130"/> Beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to poliſhed Braſs, and the voice of his words like unto the voice of a multude:</hi> So Rev 1. 13. <hi>And in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a Golden girdle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now both <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had their Revelation from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and they both ſpeak of him, as the perſon who with his own hands gave it out to them; And that it was he appears by the garb and dreſs in which they ſet him forth to you, he was clothed in linen ſaith <hi>Daniel,</hi> and clothed with a garment down to the foot ſaith <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was as the High Prieſt did uſe to wear, of which Chriſt was the Anti-type: Now it can be none but Chriſt can be intended here by theſe two Prophets, and that it was Chriſt it farther appears by <hi>Iohn,</hi> who gives him the Title of the Son of man, which Title was proper to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, both <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> tells you that the ſame perſon w<hi rend="sub">ch</hi> gave out the propheſie to them (which was clothed in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and a garment down to the foot) he was girt about the loins with a golden girdle. Thus you ſee that Chriſt is ſet forth to you as a High Prieſt, with reſpect to the garments which the High Prieſt did wear, of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the girdle (as you ſee) was a part.</p>
                  <p>2. I am to ſhew you that all the former conſiderations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the girding about of the Prieſts loins, did all meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Golden girdle of our Goſpel High Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all it denotes the reſolution which was in Chriſt to the work of mans Salvation and Redemption, Oh nothing could hinder the Lord Jeſus from undertaking the thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſin, Satan, the Curſe of the Law, the wrath of God, Grave, Death and Hell, ſtood in the way; yet he goes through all, and makes his way thorow the higheſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he might accompliſh the thing, he adventures ſoul and body, glory, happineſs, and all that was near and dear to him, in order to the effecting it, <hi>Luke 12. 50. I have a Baptiſm to be baptized with, and oh how am I ſtraitned untill it be
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93772:130"/> accompliſhed;</hi> which Baptiſm was not the Baptiſm with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for in that ſenſe he was baptized before, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 16. But it was the Baptiſm of his ſufferings, which he had ſo much a deſire to finiſh, and a reſolution to go through.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He hath as great a reſolution to bring forth ſanctifying grace in the Saints by his Spirit, as he had to bring forth juſtifying grace by his Death, <hi>Zack. 3. 4. And he anſwered and ſaid unto thoſe that stood before him, take away the filthy garments from him; and unto him he ſaid, behold I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſs away from thee, and I will cloth thee with change of garments;</hi> This was ſpoken by Chriſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Church, ver. 1, 2. But mark the reſolution of Chriſt to the procuring of ſanctifying garments (which is that inward grace and holineſs he fills them with) which he ſees his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtands in need of, ſaith Chriſt, I will do it.</p>
                  <p>It muſt and ſhall be ſo, I am reſolved, as I have procured juſtifying grace for them, ſo they ſhall be made holy, I will give them ſanctifying grace, nothing ſhall croſs my will in this matter, <hi>Ezek. 36. 25, 26, 27. Then will I ſprinkle you with clean water, and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs, and from all your idols will I cleanſe you; a new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments and do them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mark the reſolution of Chriſt to the ſanctifying of his people, he will do it, take notice of the many Repetitions of his will, there are in this place.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, So for the ſaying of his Church out of danger, when begirt about with trouble, Chriſt is reſolved upon the buſineſs (though ſometimes the Devil and wicked men may think to make their Market upon the Saints) that the gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt his Church and people, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Pſal. 12. 5. For the oppreſſion of the poor, and for the ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the needy, now will I ariſe,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and I will ſet him in ſafety from him that puffeth at him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:93772:131"/>
                  <p>Mark how much the will and reſolution of Chriſt lieth in this work of ſaving and delivering his Church out of the hands of men and Devils.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>Uſe 5.</head>
                  <p>O then how ſhould this comfort and encourage the people of God; O Sirs ſtudy the girdle of your High Prieſt Jeſus Chriſt, do you doubt of Juſtification, do you doubt of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, do you doubt of deliverance from Sin, Satan, the wrath of God, the malice of Devils and wicked men; O look up to the girdle of reſolution about the High Prieſts loins, and wait patiently upon him, for he is reſolved to get all this for you in a time of need</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the girding of the loins do imply the ſtrength which God doth afford his ſervants in the work he imploys them in or about, ſo is this abundantly made good in Chriſt our great High Prieſt; our Saviour had a very great work to do, and a weighty burthen to bear, therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he ſhould be filled with infinite ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The work he was to do would have diſcouraged all the men in the world and Angels in heaven, had they been put together to have engaged in it, for he was to conflict with four enemies, the leaſt of which hath driven the whole world before it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are Satan, Sin, the World, with all its temptations, and the juſtice of God for the breach of his royal Law; what power, force, or ſtrength, was there ever in the world that could bear up againſt one of theſe enemies; beſides, Chriſt was to deal with death it ſelf; what ſtrong <hi>Samſon,</hi> or vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the world could grable with this one ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, yet did our Saviour bring this enemy at his feet with caſe, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>Acts 2. 24. He hath looſed the bands of death, becauſe it was not poſſible he ſhould be holden by it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There muſt needs be infinite ſtrength in Chriſt,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93772:131"/> if we conſider the weight of that burthen he was to bear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſhoulders; And that was all the ſins of all the Elect in the world, a weight which makes the whole earth to groan under the burthen of it, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 22. For all our ſins were laid upon and charged on Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Iſa. 53. 6. The Lord hath laid the iniquities of us all upon him,</hi> ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith 1 <hi>Pet. 2 24. Who his ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Samſon</hi> did never carry away the gates of the City with more eaſe, then Chriſt did our ſins upon his ſhoulders; Therefore is Chriſt called a Rock, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 31. And the Rock of ſtrength and refuge, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62 7.</p>
                  <p>Now all this was Chriſt, as he was and is our High Prieſt, for this lieth in the girdle of Chriſt, which girdle he weared as our High Prieſt; therefore you are to look upon all this as yours upon believing, Chriſt needed not this himſelf, but this ſtrength was put into him for believers.</p>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:93772:132"/> glory of the conqueſt he imputes to thee, as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> in the wilderneſs did, who was a Type of Chriſt in this thing; he fought Iſraels battels for them, and conquered all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for them, and when done gives the glory of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to the Iſraelites, for he cauſeth the chief of the enemies to be brought before him, and makes them lie down, and bids the Jews to ſet their feet upon their necks, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 10. 24. So hath Chriſt done for believers.</p>
                  <p>2. If thou wouldſt get the maſtery over the remainders of corruption within thee, and the Devil and World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, then look up to Chriſt thy High Prieſt, and draw out ſtrength from him, for he is girded about with ſtrength on purpoſe to give it out to thee; ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthens me, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>3. Laſtly, the girdle in the High Prieſt denotes his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and ſincerity in the work he undertakes to do, for ſo we ſhewed you did the girding of the loins implyed ſo much as this is applied to Jeſus Chriſt who is our Goſpel High Prieſt, <hi>Iſa. 11. 5. And righteouſneſs ſhall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulneſs the girdle of his reins,</hi> ſo ſaith the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the faithfulneſs of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>Heb. 3. 5, 6. And Moſes was faithful in all his houſe as a ſervant, for a teſtimony of thoſe things which were to be ſpoken afterward, but Chriſt as a Son in his own houſe, whoſe houſe we are if we hold faſt the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the rejoycing of the hope firm to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve theſe two things in the words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> his faithfulneſs was a teſtimony of thoſe things which ſhould be ſpoken hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now what were theſe things which ſhould be ſpoken after <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, it is what all the Prophets and Apoſtles have written about, the faithfulneſs of Chriſt to his Church and people, as he is their High Prieſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he would certainly become bond to the juſtice of God as their ſurety, to give full ſatisfaction for all the wrong they have done the juſtice of God, ſo ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 40 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:93772:132"/>2. That he would ſtand in the room of his people, and take upon him every part and parcel of their guilt, this wrote <hi>Iſa.</hi> of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he would as certainly bear every part of that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment (which juſtice would have elſe poured forth upon the Elect) I ſay he would bear this himſelf as really as he did their guilts, ſo writes <hi>Iſa.</hi> alſo, ver. 5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he would certainly call home to himſelf, by the means of the Miniſtry of the word and ſpirit, every elected ſoul to the embracement of him, this writes <hi>Luke</hi> of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 So <hi>Iohn</hi> writes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And that there ſhall never be wanting to the ages of man, a ſufficiency of means in order to the bringing in the Elect of God in every age, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That as by his bloud and righteouſneſs he hath taken care to get them juſtified before God, ſo as certainly will he give out with his ſanctifying grace, the teſtimony of this (in his time) into their conſciences, ſo writes St. <hi>Paul</hi> of him, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Iſa.</hi> 26. 3.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And that if he hath begun any thing of the work of grace upon the heart of any poor ſoul (they ſhould not doubt of the ſucceſs) for he will as certainly finiſh and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And that in the mean while, what corruptions ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſoul (although he will not promiſe wholly to out them of the ſoul here in this life) yet the ſoul may aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of this, they ſhall not Rule and Reign over the ſoul as before, ſo writes St. <hi>Paul</hi> of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And as for the power of temptation which may ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſeize the ſoul, as that the ſoul may think it will at laſt for ever undoe him; Chriſt will certainly bear up the ſoul under them as that they ſhall not totally ſink the ſoul, and will as undoubtedly deliver the ſoul at laſt out of the hands of them all, ſo writes St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 13.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And for what duty he ſhall require and expect at his
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93772:133"/> peoples hands, he will look for no more, nor require of them any farther ſervice, then he ſhall give them ſtrength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, ſo ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. 27. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And that what infirmities and weakneſſes your duties ſhall be clothed withall, Chriſt will certainly over-look them upon the ſouls hearty and humble acknowledgment of them to him, ſo writes the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8, 12. with Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 9. 14.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And what ever the ſin be which may be acted and committed by any of his people (they ſhould not deſpair at the matter) for upon their hearty acknowledgment of it and endeavour to amend about it, he would certainly pardon it and it ſhall be no breach about it, ſo writes <hi>

                  <p n="13">13. You may aſſure your ſelves if ever you have careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavoured to get into a covenanted condition with him, he will take that care that nothing in heaven, earth, or hell ſhall ever work you out again, ſo writes St. <hi>Paul, Rom. 34. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39. Ier.</hi> 31. 35, 36.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And at any time if any of his people be called by him to adventure upon hard and difficult ſervice, they ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have his company with them (to aſſiſt, comfort, and refreſh them) foot by foot all along their work, <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 20</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And if they ſhall be put upon ſufferings at any time for him, he will certainly be with them to help them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them in that condition, if it be with the three Children to march through the fire, they ſhall not go one foot in the flames beyond or without Chriſt in their hand, <hi>Iſa</hi> 43 2.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And what charge they ſhall leave behind them in the ſtorm to be cared for, as Husband, Wife, Children, Parents, we need not doubt, Chriſt will certainly take care for them in our room, and better then we could, had we ſtaid amongſt them, ſo ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 37. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>5.</p>
                  <p>The other conſideration in the words to be obſerved, is
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93772:133"/> this, <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful as a ſervant, but Chriſt as ſon in his own houſe, I ſhall ſay but little as to this, you know what obligations (with reſpect to intereſt) do lay upon a Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a ſervant to be faithful in his place. Now if <hi>Moſes</hi> a ſervant were faithful to the houſe, and in the houſe, then much more may this be expected from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I have only this to ſtart about, the High Prieſt girdle, and I have done with it.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Uſe of the girdle, it was to gird the Robes ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely about him, as that they might not fall off his body, no nor ſo much as hang looſe to the body.</p>
                  <p>Thus do our Goſpel High Prieſt deal by and with his Church, he girds them all faſt to himſelf by a girdle of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that will never admit of their falling from him, nor long hanging looſe to Chriſt, the people of God are very apt to hang looſe to him, and when they are awakened to it, then they in the next place fear of falling wholly away from him, for the one doth make way for the other; if Satan can but get a ſoul a little looſe from Chriſt, he will quickly make the ſoul to call in queſtion the whole of his condition, and to think that now he is falling quite off from Jeſus Chriſt; but ſoul, againſt ſuch doubts look up to Chriſt thy High Prieſt, and there thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelf ſo faſt bound to his loins by the girdle of an indiſolvable covenant, that thou canſt never drop from him more, thou maiſt be looſe to him, but fear not, thou canſt never fall finally unleſs Chriſt fall, for thou art girded about his loins, read theſe Scriptures for thy comfort, <hi>Iſa. 11. 5. Ezek. 16. 8. Jer. 31. 3, 4. Iohn 13. 1. Iſa. 54. 89, 10. Rom. 8. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 Rom. 11. 29. John</hi> 10. 28, 29. And aſſure thy ſelf if thou doſt hang looſe to Chriſt, he will quickly be ſenſible of it, and will tuck thee up and gird thee cloſe to himſelf again as he did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beware of that, it may be ſuch a gird as you may feel it in your bones many days after, as <hi>David</hi> did in the like caſe, read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 8.</p>
                  <p>I now come to ſpeak of the Miter and the plate of Gold
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93772:134"/> which was to be faſtned on it before, near upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
                  <p>As for the Miter it was to be put upon the Prieſts head when the holy garments were to be put on, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 28 with <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 6.</p>
                  <p>Now this part of the Prieſts atire is what reſpected Chriſt as the Head of the body; we have ſhewed you already how that the Robe it ſelf, with the things belonging to them were what did reſpect the Church, the body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And this atire (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Miter and Crown, did more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to Chriſt as the Head of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with the Miter, which was the Crown and glory (if I may ſo expreſs it) of all the other attributes of Chriſt; for if you look into the two firſt Chapters of the Revelations, you ſhall find what ever comfort did run down upon the Saints thorow any Title given to God, yet it did all Centre in the Prieſtly office of Chriſt, to which the Miter belonged, in <hi>Rev. 2, 1. You have this Title given of Christ, He h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now do you but look into the 13. ver you may ſee the fountain of all theſe ſtreams in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks. I <hi>ſaw one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a Golden girdle;</hi> ſo that here it is from whence the Titles (which are given to Chriſt) do ariſe, they all flow from the Prieſtly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, who wears the Prieſtly Miter; the truth is, its from the Miter upon Chriſts Head that we draw all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Alas Brethren, what comfort could we take in God himſelf but through Chriſt, and what comfort could we take in Chriſt, but as he wears the Miter upon his Head as our High Prieſt, whatſoever comfort we have in any other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, namely, as a King or Prophet, it all originated in the Prieſtly office of Chriſt, the truth is, the Prieſtly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93772:134"/> of Chriſt is an office of meer love and tender compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſet up on purpoſe for the ſuccour and relief of poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, there is no mixture of terrour in this office of Chriſt, there is a mixture of terrour in the other offices of Chriſt, the Lord Chriſt is King, and hath a Kingly office, and by it Rules over his Church, and Rules over all the world, but all do not obtain mercy that he Rules over; <hi>As for thoſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould Rule over them, bring them forth and ſlay them before me, Luke</hi> 19 27.</p>
                  <p>But there is not the leaſt mixture of terrour in this of his Prieſtly office, the Miter ſhews nothing but grace, and love, and wonderful compaſſion, infinite bowels of tender love to the ſinner, a God reconciled in Chriſt by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which was ſlain for ſinners; the bloud of which ſpeaks to you better things then the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> for the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> beſpoke ſin committed, and a guilty ſoul, and an angry God, but Chriſts bloud beſpeaks ſin remitted and pardoned, and a God recorcied again, the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> ſpakes for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance from under the ground, but the bloud of Chriſt ſpeaks for grace, mercy, pardon and reconciliation again from under the Altar; <hi>Abels</hi> bloud beſpake the ſinner under the Curſe, but Chriſts bloud ſpeaks him into the bleſſing again, <hi>Acts 3. 26. Abels</hi> bloud ſpake the ſoul at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with God, but the bloud of Chriſt ſpeaks him very nigh God again, <hi>Eph. 2. 13. But now in Chriſt Jeſus ye that were ſometimes afar off, are made nigh by the bloud of Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93772:135"/> ſuccour in a time of doubt and danger, what was the great relief amongſt the Jews againſt their ſins, the Jews you may obſerve they had many reliefs when they were in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if at any time they were ſtung with the fiery Serpents, then they had their brazen Serpent to look unto as a relief againſt that diſtreſs, when they wanted water they had their Rock to make at as a relief againſt that diſtreſs; when they wanted bread they had their Manna from heaven as a relief againſt that diſtreſs, and if they ſinned whether they did go, then they took a ſacrifice and went unto the Prieſt and he was to offer for them, ſo that the Prieſtly office then was the only relief they had againſt ſin</p>
                  <p>So now the Prieſtly office of Chriſt is the only relief and ſuccour the people of God have againſt all temptations, doubts, and fears under heaven; O make much uſe of the Miter in times of fear, look unto it as the Jews were to look to their brazen Serpent upon the pole when ſtung with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, ſo when ever thou art ſtung with the Serpent of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and guilt, and horour, and terrour about guilt, look up with an eye of faith to this Miter, the Crown (as I may call it) of his Prieſtly office and thou ſhalt be healed and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all thy ſtingings, ſo ſaith Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Iſa. 45. 22.

                  <p>Mark, look unto me, he doth not bid you to look to that unhollowed Bear the Pope, who to deceive the poor miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world of their Eſtates and Wealth, hath feigned a Miter and puts him upon his Head, and Bug-bears the world with it, as if he were ſome great one, which by the pretended power of his conjuring State and Croſs-keys of hell afrights the poor ignorant world into an opinion of ſome more then ordinary Authority muſt reſide in this Beaſt for his Cap ſake; when alas he nothing but Cheats the world by it, both of their ſouls and treaſure, he is a Limb of the Devil to Cheat men of their ſouls, becauſe he keeps them in ignorance about the Prieſthood of Chriſt, and arrogates and aſſumes
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93772:135"/> that Authority as proper to himſelf, he ſaith he hath the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon his Head, and he is in the Prieſtly Chair, and he can procure pardon with God for ſins, and he hath the keys of Hell and Death (which the holy Ghoſt only attributes to Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18.) And he can open Purgatory and let out of torment, and he hath the key of <hi>David</hi> (which the holy Ghoſt gives only to Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3 7.) And he can open hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and let into glory: O horrid Blaſphemy! What a beaſt is this, and how much to be abandoned by all thoſe that love Chriſt and their ſouls, how doth he diſ-throne and ſhut out Chriſt of his great office as a Prieſt and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>2. He Cheats poor ſouls of their Eſtates here, becauſe he takes their money of them to ſave them from ſin, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them of ſome torment, and to let them into heaven when he himſelf ſhall not eſcape the vengeance of Chriſt, but ſhall be for his juggling and deceit tormented in fire and brimſtone for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20, 21 Where the whole Rabble of that gang ſhall eternally dwell together.</p>
                  <p>And as for others (<hi>viz.</hi>) the leſſer ſort of Popes, that imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the High Prieſt in his garments with reſpect to his Cap and Linen Ephod, its a clear denying of Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, and <hi>John</hi> ſaith theſe are Anti-chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 3. For if theſe garments were Types of Chriſt, then they were only to continue untill the coming of Chriſt, ſo reaſons the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. Who ſaith that theſe things were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of good things to come, but not the very Image; and therefore when theſe good things were come which was the ſubſtance, then the ſhadow muſt give place as no longer of uſe, ſo ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> chap. 2. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 23.

                  <p>The next thing we are to take notice of, is the plate of Gold which was placed upon the fore-head of the High
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93772:136"/> Prieſt faſtned to the Mitre, wherein was engraven in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters theſe words, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> Exod. 28. 36, 37.</p>
                  <p>The purpoſe of this very plate with the Letters written in it, was for the High Prieſt to take upon him all the failings, imperfections, and weakneſſes of the peoples duties in the Worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>The Plate was to bear upon it the peoples ſins which they would contract in the Worſhip of God, and the Letters en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon the Plate was to bear out the Prieſt before the Lord that he died not, <hi>Exod. 28. 36. 37, 38. And thou ſhalt make a plate of pure Gold, and grave upon it the engravenings of a ſignet, Holineſs to the Lord; and thou ſhalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the Mitre, upon the fore-front of the Mitre it ſhall be, and it ſhall be upon Aarons forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Iſrael ſhall hollow in all their holy gifts: and it ſhall alwayes be upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that they may be accepted before the Lord.</hi> This ſtill looks to Jeſus Chriſt our Goſpel High Prieſt, and tells us what he is to do, and doth do for Believers, he takes upon him all the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and infirmities of his peoples duties. O what a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ground of comfort is this to a doubting ſoul: I know ſome poor ſouls have had their backs bowed down with this kinde of guilt, who when they have been in the Worſhip of God, as in Prayer, hearing of the Word, or breaking of Bread: when they have conſidered with what ſad frames they have been in the Worſhip: how hath that troubled them, when they have minded the hypocriſie that appeared in their hearts while in the work; thoſe vain wandering thoughts, that deadneſs and dull, drowſie, tiredneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with which their work was mixed withal: beſides when they have conſidered with how much ignorance, and little ſaith, and want of love to God, and his work in hand, they were attended with, O how hath this perplexed ſome poor ſouls, and how deeply hath this ſunk others into the pit of deſpair, putting them upon reſolving never more to hear the Word, or Pray, or receive the Sacrament: O they
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:93772:136"/> never Worſhip God, but they ſin againſt him, and make their caſe worſe then it was before.</p>
                  <p>All this hath been for want of knowledge in this bleſſed myſtery of the plate faſtened upon the fore-front of the High Prieſts Mitre. The Devil keeps them in ſuſpence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this thing, ſhews the ſoul his guilt, but will not ſuffer him to ſee the plate upon the fore-front of the Prieſts My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, which was appointed on purpoſe for them to lay up their gilt upon. O therefore for thy comfort poor ſoul, when ever thou comeſt into the Worſhip of God, thou mayeſt come boldly without fear as to that: what guilts thou either haſt, or ſhall contract upon thy ſoul in the Worſhip of God, (provided they are not wilful guilts) there is a plate of Gold prepared to bear all, thou ſhalt bear none of them thy ſelf. O bleſs God for this great mercy to thy ſoul, and rejoyce in it as thy great favour; make much uſe of it as thy beſt of priviledges: ſtudy it as the higheſt of comforts, and live up to the God of this mercy, with the greateſt of faithfulneſs, and to the higheſt pitch of holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This was to be a ſtanding priviledge at all times, for all Believers to ſuch a continual ſweetneſs and comfort from in point of acceptation with God; for <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt was to wear it alwayes upon the fore-front of the Mitre, that they might be accepted before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>This was not to be worn once or twice, but alwayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; ſo that until Chriſt puts off his Mitre, and layes aſide his prieſtly work, thou mayſt aſſure thy ſelf until then, thoſe ſins of infirmity which will cleave to thy duties, ſhall not render them or thee diſacceptable before God, if thou relieſt faithfully upon this High Prieſt in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>We now come to ſpeak of the Crown which this High Prieſt was to wear, as well as this Mitre, and the Crown was to be ſet upon the Mitre on the Prieſts head, <hi>Exod. 29 6. And thou ſhalt put the Mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mitre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Crown upon the Prieſts head ſet forth to you the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93772:137"/> Kingly Office of Jeſus Chriſt, which ſprings from the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office of Chriſt; he is a King to rule in and over his Church, becauſe he is a High Prieſt to the Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Crown muſt ſtand upon the Mitre; the Mitre doth keep up the Crown, not the Crown the Mitre. The Mitre being under the Crown, ſhews you that the Kingly Office of Chriſt hath its foundation in the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, as was ſhewed you before from the firſt of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſhews firſt, that Chriſt hath power to give out what Laws, Rules, Cuſtomes, and Ordinances he pleaſe for his Church and people to walk by; for he hath a Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head as well as a Mitre.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That all duty, and ſubjection, and obedience ought to be given to him both in ſoul and body, for he is a King, <hi>Pſalm 2. 6. I have ſet my king upon my holy hill Sion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We do not read that any of the Prieſts beſides the High Prieſt did wear a Crown: we read that they did wear Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, but not a Crown, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 40. The Crown was only for the High Prieſt, ſhewing us, as the Prieſt was a Type of Chriſt, that all Rule and chief Authority belongs to Chriſt: its Chriſt onely can make or impoſe any Laws upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of his people: ſo ſaith the Spirit, <hi>Rev. 4. 11. Thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honour, and power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet how common is it to ſee the inferiour ſort of Prieſts, that ſhould content themſelves with wearing the Bonnet, to catch the High Prieſts Crown from off his head, and to leave the High Prieſt nothing to wear but their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets; and given him to underſtand, if he will not wear them he muſt ſit bare headed before them. I mean how do men who pretend to be the Miniſters and Vicars of Chriſt, pull his prieſtly Diadem from off his head, and ſo rob him of his principle glory, in arrogating a power to themſelves of making and impoſing ſpiritual Laws upon the conſciences of his poor people, as rules for them to walk by, which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93772:137"/> and traditions the word of Chriſt never knew or ſpake of in the leaſt. O what greater indignity can there be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Crown of Chriſt then this: not onely ſo, but if the poor Lambs of Chriſt (who are as dear to him as his own blood) will not comply with their Canons; they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently run upon them with ruine and deſtruction both to them and theirs, without the leaſt dram of mercy ſhewed them: Should a Subject deal thus with his Prince, who would advocate ſuch a ones caſe at the Bar; but how much Chriſt thinks himſelf bound to theſe men for this piece of ſervice both to himſelf and his people, let the world judge.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas 'tis ſaid that the Crown was ſet upon the Mitre, it is to ſhew Believers how ſweet the Kingly Office, Power, and Authority of Chriſt is ſweetned to them by the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt: Its the Prieſtly Mitre makes the Kingly Crown ſo ſweet and lovely to men. The grace which flows from Chriſt as Prieſt, makes the Law which flows from Chriſt as King ſo delightful and precious.</p>
                  <p>What ſtrange prejudicated opinions have men of the Law, of the Crown of Chriſt, when they look on it apart from the Mitre of Chriſts Prieſt-hood: how formidable and cruel doth the Law look to them; how do men ſhun it and avoid it as death it ſelf: its an unreaſonable Law, it requires im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities, ſuch things as can never be obtained or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by me: it affords me no aſſiſtance, no ſtrength, let me do what I can it damns me at laſt. This the ſoul inſtead of ſubjecting to it, fights with it as his worſt of enemies: ſo ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom. 8 7. The carnal minded man is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d can be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when the ſoul is brought in to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, as his High Prieſt, and hath taſted of the grace of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and is made to ſee the Mitre under the Crown, which it did not ſee before, and underſtands, that all the terrour of the Crowns Law is ſuckt in by the Mitres grace. O then the ſoul comes to have other thoughts of the Law of God
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93772:138"/> then ever it had before. O ſaith the ſoul; how miſerably was my underſtanding darkened, that I ſhould ſo wickedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of it, as an unreaſonable Law, and a cruel Law; a Law which required brick to be made without ſtraw. O but now I ſee it was my miſtake and great ignorance. O it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no more then it will help in the doing: its a Law which hath the ſpirit of life in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. That will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to its own performances; a Law flowing from the Crown, but its a Crown upon the Mitre, which is ſo far from killing of me, that it giveth me ſpiritual life, and frees me from the Law of ſin and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom. 7. 22. I delight in the Law of God after the inner man:</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>David, Pſalm 119. 72. The Law of thy mouth is better then ten thouſands of gold or ſilver.</hi> So <hi>Pſalm 19. 10. More to be deſired is thy law then gold, yea then much fine gold, ſweeter alſo then the honey, and the honey comb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O every part of the work and worſhip of Chriſt is ſweet now, when the ſoul ſees its the Law of a reconciler; the work of an advocate, the worſhip of a bleſſed High Prieſt, which he is imployed in and about. O its the Law of one who hath ſhed his deareſt blood for me, to ſatisfie Juſtice, its the work of a High Prieſt which preſents me in himſelf without ſpot to God, and hath clothed me with the Robe of his Righteouſneſs, and made me an heir of Glory, a childe of God; a citizen of the new Jeruſalem. O this makes the work of Chriſts Kingdom delightful work to the ſoul now.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. 32.</hi> I now come to ſpeak of the fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which is the manner of the Conſecrating of the Prieſt, which is as followeth.</head>
               <p>THe High Prieſt being thus attired, then was <hi>Moſes</hi> to take a young Bullock, and two Rams without blemiſh, and unleavened bread, and unleavened cakes, tempered with oyl, and offer this with the two Bullocks, and tvvo Rams un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for the Prieſt, <hi>Exodus</hi> 29. 1, 2. with 19. 20. Then was <hi>Moſes</hi> to take a veſſel of oyl, and pour it on the Prieſts head and anoint him, ver. 7.</p>
               <p>In which conſecration we may note two things.</p>
               <p>1. Something which related to the Type it ſelf.</p>
               <p>2. What related to the Ante-type Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What of this conſecration related to the Type, or High Prieſt himſelf, and what was this: the materials made uſe of about his Conſecration, did highly teſtifie, that he himſelf was but a poor, weak, frail man; and that although he were called to ſo great an Office, as to interpoſe between God and the people, to make reconciliation for them; yet he vvas no farther efficacious then as he vvas the Type of him that onely could take avvay ſin, vvhich vvas Jeſus Chriſt held forth in him. Thus much both himſelf and the people likevviſe might inform themſelves in the manner of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeration; for there vvere tvvo Rams and a young Bullock muſt be ſlain and offered to God in ſacrifice for him before be could ſtand in Gods preſence to adminiſter for the people. Some ſacrifices of pacification and attonement muſt be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:93772:139"/> to God for the Prieſt himſelf, as well as for the people; vvhich taught both the Prieſt and People, that there vvas no reconciliation vvith God to be had by the High Prieſts means any further then both Prieſt and people had an eye of Faith upon Jeſus Chriſt held out by him: ſo reaſons the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in <hi>Heb. 7. 26, 27. For ſuch an High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the heavens, who needeth not daily as thoſe High Prieſts to offer up ſacrifice, firſt for his own ſins, and then for the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you ſee the legal Prieſt ſtood in need of a ſacrifice for himſelf, and he was to offer a ſacrifice for himſelf as well as for the people: there ſalvation and reconciliation could not be wrought out by the Prieſt, but by another, which was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. As the thing related to Jeſus Chriſt, it ſhews us thus much, that whatever our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath done, doth do, or yet ſhall do in heaven, as our great High Prieſt, it takes its riſe from the Death and Paſſion of himſelf: You ſee the High Prieſt under the Law could not be a High Prieſt, without he were conſecrated ſo in the death of ſomething which muſt be ſlain as a ſacrifice to God.</p>
               <p>So did Chriſt lay down his life as a ſacrifice to God here upon the Croſs, before he could act as our great High Prieſt in Heaven before ever he could perform the work of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion within the Tabernacle, he muſt firſt offer himſelf up a ſlain ſacrifice to God (for pacification) without the camp, <hi>Heb. 13. 12. Wherefore Jeſus alſo, that he might ſanctifie the people with his own blood, ſuffered without the gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But why was Moſes to take a young Bullock to make a ſacrifice for the Prieſts conſecration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe any thing when its young and lively, is better then that which is old and feeble. It was firſt to ſhew the High Prieſt under the Law that God expected he ſhould be lively and ſtrong for the Lord in all he did for him; he was to conſecrate the beſt of his years, and the beſt of his time, ſtrength, and abilities for the Lord, that the worſhip
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:93772:139"/> of God called for the beſt of our all for its ſervice: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was he to be conſecrated with a young Bullock, not an old or feeble one.</p>
               <p>2. It ſhews us that time or age never enfeebles our great High Prieſt in heaven; the Prieſt was to be conſecrated with a young Bullock, ſhewing you that the Prieſt. Believers have in heaven, grows never old, he is not ſubject to tire or faint in his employment; he is as lively and active in his work for his people now, as at the firſt day he entred heaven as their Prieſt: and ſo is it lookt upon by the Father, that makes our High Prieſt ſtill ſo prevallent upon the Heart of God: he is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We might make this uſe of it to perſwade all young perſons to dedicate themſelves to God betime, in the prime of their dayes, when the marrow is warm in the bones. A young Bullock, not an old, muſt be offered to God in ſacrifice. O ſo ſhould it be with you my friends, would you offer up your ſelves as an acceptable ſacrifice to God. O then let it be in your youth: minde that exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ. 12. 1.

               <p>Alas Sirs, when we live ſo long in ſin, as to ſpend the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of our bodies in the ſervice of the Devil. How do we think God ſhould be pleaſed with the offering up of our old dry bones for a ſacrifice upon his Altar. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth more ingage God to take care for a ſoul in old age, then when a ſoul is careful to conſecrate himſelf to God in his youthful dayes. Then was <hi>Moſes</hi> to take a veſſel of oyl and pour it on the Prieſts head, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the anointing of him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 7.</p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:93772:140"/>
               <p>The oyl of anointing poured forth upon the High Prieſt ſignified theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It ſignifieth the great endowments of the Prieſt with reſpect to the gifts of the Spirit, which ſhould be upon him, as neceſſary to the work he was to do for the people, for ſo is the anointing underſtood ſometimes, 1 <hi>Sam. 10. 1. 6. And Samuel took a vial of oyl and poured it upon the head of Saul, and kiſſed him, and ſaid, Is it not becauſe the Lord hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed thee to be captain over his inheritance.</hi> Now look into the 6. verſe, and there you ſhall ſee the gifts of the Spirit ſpoken of, that ſhould fit him for government, an office un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he was anointed, <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou ſhalt propheſie with them, and be turned into another man.</hi> And look you into the 10th. verſe, and there you ſhall ſee the gifts of the Spirit upon him.</p>
               <p>This ſhews us what infinite gifts of all manner of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions fell upon Chriſt to fit him for the great work of the Prieſthood: ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Iſa. 61. 1. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me.</hi> A Spirit of counſel, that he might be able to give ſound advice at all times to his Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6 A Spirit of courage and ſtrength, that he might go through all oppoſitions for his people; therefore is he called, the mighty God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. A Spirit of wiſdom, that he might be able to out-wit his ſubtle adverſaries in hell, or on the earth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. A Spirit of love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he might not reject for, but pitty his people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their temptations, weakneſſes, and infirmities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17, 18. A Spirit of pardon, that he might be able to paſs by his peoples ſins, iniquities, and tranſgreſſions, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 9. 17. A Spirit of faithfulneſs as not to neglect his people in any condition, nor wanting in the giving out to them any ſupply to his people, which the Father hath both given the Saints by promiſe, and laid into Chriſt, as their ſtore-houſe of grace and wiſdom for that purpoſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36. 5.</p>
               <p>All this was in Chriſt the Head, for the uſe of the Body myſtical, as the ſtreams are in the fountain, not onely to be
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:93772:140"/> imployed for them, but to be given down to them into their ſouls according as they ſhall draw it out of this Well by the veſſel of believing, ſo ſaith the Church, who made uſe of Chriſt upon this account, <hi>Iſa. 12 2, 3. Behold God is my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will truſt and not be afraid, for the Lord Jehovah is my ſtrength and ſong, and is become my ſalvation, therefore</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>with joy ſhall ye draw water out of the wells of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It denotes the perfection of grace and holineſs which was to dwel in Chriſt, for ſo much may we underſtand by the pouring forth of the anointing, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>It pleaſed the father that in him. ſhould all fulneſs dwell, Col.</hi> 1. 19. A fulneſs of grace and holineſs, that from him we might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it for our uſe and benefit in this life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The anointing of the High Prieſt, did ſignifie that legal right he had to adminiſter in the Prieſts office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another man, hence is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 5. 4. And no man taketh this honour upon him but he that was called of God, as was Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this would afford great comfort to a ſoul if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was not only a Prieſt or an Advocate, but he was an anointed Prieſt and Advocate, one who had a legal right to the place, he came not in the wrong way, therefore no Thief or Robber, we need not doubt, no one can invalue Chriſts work when its done for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, meerly for want of right to officiate; you know if a Councellour at Law undertake to plead a mans caſe for him and ſhould diſpute it never ſo ably, and ſhould carry it in Law, yet if this can be objected againſt the Councellour that he is not lawfully inducted to the place as a Councellour, all will be invalued that hath been done and ſaid, and looked upon as of no force.</p>
               <p>O therefore ſoul, if Chriſt intercedes as a High Prieſt, and pleads as an Advocate at the Throne of grace for thee, thou needſt not fear of thy Caſe, there is not any enemy thou haſt can hurt thee in this Caſe, ſhould the Law object, the Juſtice
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:93772:141"/> of God object, ſhould Satan object againſt thy Chriſt its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he had the legal anointings of the father upon him to in right him to his work, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Iſa 61. 1. The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, and he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel;</hi> That is, the ſenſe of what he means by preaching.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That which was appointed to conſecrate the Prieſt withall, the Prieſt was to eat it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 32, 33. Which ſhews us that the work of the Prieſthood lives in the heart of Chriſt, it ſhould be of that infinite delight to him, as food is to the hungry ſtomack, the Prieſt ſhould eat in his office and work, he ſhould as it were live upon it, and feed and feaſt himſelf with it as a man doth on his daily food ſo ſaith Chriſt himſelf ſpeaking of this great work of the Prieſthood, it is my meat and drink to be imployed in and about it, <hi>Iohn 4. 34. It is my meat and drink to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this is to encourage doubting ſouls to make uſe of Chriſt, to bring their ſins and ſores, and ſorrows, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and corruptions to him; and their leporiſiecal ſouls to him, and the ignorant, hard, unbelieving, dead, carnal, proud, luſtful, revengeful hearts to him as their High Prieſt, and lay them down at the door of his Prieſtly office. O this is meat and drink to Chriſt the High Prieſt. O for Chriſt to ſee his door crouded up full with halted, mained, blind, leporous ſouls, all waiting for a cure. O this makes the heart of Chriſt leap in heaven, ſaith <hi>Pſal. 40. 8. I delight to do thy will O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what was the great will of God, it was that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and damned ſhould be ſaved by the Prieſthood of Chriſt, and that he ſhould preach good tidings to the meek, and that he ſhould bind up the broken-hearted, and preach liberty to the captive, and let looſe the priſoners, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the acceptable year of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. And that he ſhould comfort all that mourn of the Elect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 1, 2. O ſaith Chriſt this is my delight, its my meat, and drink, to do my fathers will, remember the Prieſt hath eaten in that with which he was conſecrated.</p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:93772:141"/>
               <p>Secondly, So ſhould it be with all the Miniſters of the Goſpel, with what delght ſhould they go about their work; O ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the goodneſs of God conſtraineth us, or the love of God conſtraineth us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 14. This work was as meat and drink to him, St. <hi>Paul</hi> had eaten in his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating matter, which was bitter in his belly, but as ſweet as Honey to his taſte, as its ſaid of the little book <hi>John</hi> was to eat, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 9.</p>

There he anſwereth all objections which may be made in Heaven by the Law againſt us, he is there to gather up all our Inditements which may be laid into our charge, and he is always there for this work, Chriſt is never abſent when there is need for his preſence on our behalf, ſaith the Apoſtle, he ever liveth to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us, its likewiſe ſaid that the people were not to go into the Tabernacle, but were to ſtand without at the door of the Tabernacle, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>6. 17.</p>
               <p>This ſhews us two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The dark ſtate which God held them under in compariſon to us Goſpellers, it was little of the glory or of the myſtery of the grace of the Goſpel which that people knew; its true, they knew they had a High Prieſt within, in the Tabernacle, within the veil of it, but what he did or act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they were not to look into, what manifeſtations he had of God, or glorious diſcoveries from God, they were not to ſee or have any knowledge of, therefore if the miniſtration of the Law were glorious, much more will the miniſtration of the Goſpel exceed in glory, ſo reaſons St. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And he tells you wherein the Goſpel is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorious, in that the veil is taken away, and we can now with open face behold as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, ver. 16. 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſhews us that at beſt while we are in this Tabernacle of our body, we are abſent from our greateſt Viſion of glory, we are but in the outer Court, we behold on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the back-ſide of the Tabernacle in compariſon to what we ſhall ſee when we come to paſs within the veil where our High Prieſt is, he ſaith, <hi>Paul</hi> at beſt, <hi>We walk by faith and not by ſight, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p>We have here but a few drops of our true Tabernacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory brought whom to us by the eye of faith through Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; O but when we are out of the body we ſhall
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93772:142"/> ſwim in the <hi>Rivers of all glorious perfection,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 16. 11. (Where we ſhall be brought) <hi>into the preſence of God, where ſhall be the fulneſs of joy, at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for evermore:</hi> therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 5. 8. We are confident I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> Who would deſire to live in this dark dungeon Tabernacle ſtate apart from thoſe celeſtial glories; but rather who would covet, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, to be at whom to this bleſſed Canaan of reſt, where all true bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwells.</p>
               <p>Again, Its obſerved that the people were to bring their offerings, and lay them down at the door of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the Prieſt was to take it and offer it for them before the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 3. 4, 5. This teacheth what believers ſhould do now in Goſpel dayes, bring all their offerings to the Lord Chriſt, all the duties in worſhip, and offer it to him that he may preſent it in his own name to God. O how doth this reprove that vain opinion of the Papiſts, who dream of I know not how many High Prieſts in Heaven, whom they adore with that reſpect, which is onely due to Chriſt, as the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God, as they can term her, and Saint <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> beſides many other late canonized Saints, whom they attribute the honour of the Prieſthood unto, unto whom they dedicate the Services: Pray what Saint or Angel were the Jews to create to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this great work, beſides their High Prieſt which was of the Lords own inſtitution by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As to the work the High Prieſt was to do when in the Tabernacle within the rail.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he was to take the blood of the ſacrifice, and to ſprinkle the mercy-ſeat therewith, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 14, 15. which ſhews the prevalency and force of Chriſts interceſſion now in heaven for us: Chriſt enters heaven with the worth of his Merits, and in the vertue of his Blood, and ſhews the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſufficient ground for what he intercedes about. Lord here is my Blood for this requeſt, and for the other petition
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:93772:143"/> which I put up to thee in the behalf of my people below; if I ask grace or pardon, Lord, here is my blood upon the mercy-ſeat: if I ask deliverance for them from their enemies, Lord, here is my blood for it upon the mercy-ſeat.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Prieſt was to adde to this ſtrong cryes and prayers, by the burning incenſe Altar for the people, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for pardon for them, and that he would accept their perſons, and their ſacrifices, and would be their God, and would bleſs their ſouls, and would ſend them help from his holy Sanctuary, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 12, 13. This is the very work of Chriſt now in Heaven, the bleſſing of his people, with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things, is from him, its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Chriſt; <hi>Acts 3. 26. Unto you firſt God having raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt ſent him to bleſs you, in turning every one of you from his iniquities:</hi> therefore ſoul, what ever thou wanteſt of this nature, apply thy ſelf to the Prieſt of Bleſſings, and thou ſhalt not fail.</p>
               <p>Again, then was the Prieſt to take of the Incenſe and caſt it into the fire, which was upon the Incenſe Altar, that ſo a cloud of Incenſe might ariſe before the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9. 22, 23. This was to ſhew us for our comfort, what abundance of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable matter goeth up to God in the interceſſion of Chriſt, a whole cloud of Incenſe: and certainly this muſt prevail with God in the behalf of his people; for that's the purpoſe of Chriſts offering up incenſe; it was not for himſelf, but his people: it is the Incenſe of his own bleſſed worth and excellency, which is in a way of powerful Interceſſion, of fered up to God with his peoples duties, to make them and their ſervices a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to God: and after this manner, and to this purpoſe you have our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented again by the Spirit to <hi>John</hi> after his Aſcention, <hi>

                     </gap>.</hi> 8. 3, 4. Where the purpoſe of the going up of this cloud of Incenſe is laid open to you; it is as I have ſaid, to perfume all the reſt of the Saints prayers, duties, and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as that they may be a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to God: this makes the weakeſt ſervices of the weakeſt Believer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:93772:143"/> to God: therefore ſoul, when ever thou art about to perform any duty to God, and findeſt that thou canſt not do it but with weakneſs, yea, much weakneſs; then take that weak duty and caſt it into the Incenſe fire of interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſtandeth upon the Altar Chriſt, in the veſſel of the hot burning coals of his zeal, and love to thee, and for thy good, and then it will aſcend up, with the reſt (of Chriſts and his peoples) to God, in that great cloud where it will be acceptable indeed.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 34.</hi> What the Prieſt was to do for the people upon all occaſions beſides his ſolemn Work in the Tabernacle.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, the High Prieſt was to take notice of every unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſhould be found amongſt the people, either in their perſons, garments, or in their houſes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. from the 3. to the 40. verſe. as that if any plague, or leproſie, ſore or ulcer, ſhould break forth upon the perſon of any of the people, then were they to go to the High Prieſt and ſhew it him, and he was to look upon it and endeavour their cleanſing. All this is to be ſet upon a door of acceſs for a poor doubting ſoul to come to Chriſt in the worſt of times: for, look what work the High Prieſt under the Law was to do for the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the fleſh, the ſame is Chriſt, a Believers Goſpel High Prieſt, to do for <hi>Abraham</hi> according to Faith: and this action of the High Prieſt to the Iſraelites, in a caſe of bodily mallodies, leads you to Chriſt
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93772:144"/> in a caſe of ſpiritual malladies. I believe the want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge into this myſtery hath occaſioned many doubts and fears in many poor ſouls, who hath not had Satan a little wanting to make the moſt of their ignorance in this matter in a way of heaping on their trouble, vvho ſtir, up corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in the ſoul what he can, and labours to create guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſcience; and vvhen he hath filled the ſoul vvith all manner of ſores, and ſpiritual plagues, and running griefs, then doth Satan labour to plaiſter them abroad upon the conſcience, to the affrighting of the ſoul off of Chriſt, and tells the ſoul, that certainly the holineſs of Chriſt vvill ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure to have fellovvſhip vvith ſuch a ſoul; his nature is too pure to caſt an eye upon ſuch an impure piece as the ſoul is; therefore the ſoul vvere better ſit ſtill vvhere he is, then to think of going out to Chriſt; for it vvill be but loſt labour: Thus he labours to over-ſhoot the Prieſtly office of Chriſt, and ſhevvs the ſoul much of Chriſt, according to his divine Nature, not ſuffering the ſoul to have the leaſt vievv of, conſidered as a High Prieſt, vvho vvas appointed to be ſuch, on purpoſe to have to do vvith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>O therefore ſoul be not diſcouraged for the future, let not Satan hinder thee for time to come of making uſe of Chriſt, in times vvhen thou findeſt thy ſores, and plagues, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted iſſues upon thy ſoul. O then above all times come
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93772:144"/> to Chriſt; if thou at ſuch a time as this is ſtandeſt off from Chriſt, thou art guilty of robbing Chriſt of one great part of the glory of his High Prieſthood: thou ſhut'ſt out Chriſt of doing that work (which as a Prieſt) he was ſent into the world to do. O where wilt thou go to have thy caſe better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or who ſhall cure theſe wounds, ſickneſſes, ſores, lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and guilts, which Sin and Satan hath created upon thee if thou come not to Jeſus Chriſt. O this is the good Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan that takes up the ſoul wounded by the ſpiritual thieves, and bounds up his wounds, and pours oyl into his griefs, and healeth all his diſeaſes, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 36.</p>
                  <p>O therefore come to Chriſt, make uſe of him as thy High Prieſt, bring thy ſoul with all its corruptions, ſores, and plagues, and running griefs upon thee to him, lay it down at his door, tell him that thou haſt brought a ſoul full of the plague and leproſie, full of unbelief, full of the ſores of pride, hardneſs of heart, impenitency, revenge, hypocriſie, luſt, worldly mindedneſs, a ſoul full of the iſſues of vain thoughts, and plead with Chriſt for a cure: tell him that he is the High Prieſt appointed by the Father for this very end and purpoſe, not to reject thee for thy miſery, but to pitty thee under it, and to ſhew mercy to thee about it, and to help thee out of it, <hi>Heb. 2. 17. Wherefore it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren in all things, that he might be a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful high prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ſins of the people, in that himſelf hath ſuffered, being ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Who can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the war, for that he himſelf alſo is compaſſed with infirmities.</hi> Here it was <hi>David</hi> run in the like caſe, when his ſores and griefs of corruption run upon him: He did not do as a great many troubled ſouls have done, namely, then to run from Chriſt, <hi>Pſ. 38 3 4. 5, 6, 7, 8. There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh, becauſe of thy anger, neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin, for mine iniquities are gone over my head as a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me: My wounds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93772:145"/> becauſe of my fooliſhneſs,</hi> I <hi>am troubled,</hi> I <hi>am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long, for my loins are filled with a loathſome diſeaſe, and there is no ſoundneſſe in my fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But did this drive <hi>David</hi> from Jeſus Chriſt, no ſurely, but rather put a neceſſity upon him to make the more haſte towards him in order to cure, therefore in the 9. Verſe and 15. Verſe, <hi>Lord all my deſire is before thee, and my groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not hid from thee, for in thee Lord do</hi> I <hi>hope, thou wilt hear O Lord my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the Prieſt was to take notice of their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal uncleanneſs, ſo alſo of the uncleanneſſe in their houſes, <hi>Lev, 14 35, 36. And he that oweth the houſe, ſhall come and tell the Prieſt, ſaying, it ſeemeth to me that there is as it were the Plague in the houſe, then the Prieſt ſhall command that they empty the houſe before the Prieſt goeth into it to ſee the Plague that all that is in the houſe be not made unclean, and afterward the Prieſt ſhall go into ſee the houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the end for which the Prieſt was to view the houſe, you may ſee in the ſame Chapter, it was that he might endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the cleanſing of it if the plague were in it; of the ſame uſe is Chriſt to his Goſpel-houſe, which is his Church, if the plague enter into it, the plague of diſcention and diſcord, the plague or leproſie of formality, or the plague of a luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm ſpirit, or the plague of errour and unſound Doctrine; its proper to Jeſus Chriſt to take notice of this in his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and he doth ſo, read <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. 4, 5. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in all ſuch Caſes, its the duty of the Churches of Chriſt to apply themſelves to him for redreſs, if Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the uſe of faſting and fervent prayer would more preſs upon Chriſt for help in this caſe, I doubt not, but we ſhould have more purer and unſtained Churches by far then we have amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>Was there ever more need for Churches to make uſe of Chriſt upon this account then now, had ever the Iſraelite
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93772:145"/> more cauſe to go to the Prieſt and ſay, it ſeemeth to me the plague is in the houſe, then Chriſtians have to go to Chriſt and ſay, it ſeemeth to me the plague is in the houſe; is not the plague of a formal, curſed, lukewarm ſpirit in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, are not the walls of it over-ſpread with the hollow, greeniſh, and reddiſh ſtrakes to be ſeen there, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 14. 37.</p>
                  <p>Are they not over-ſpread with the plague of Contention and Diſcord, was there ever more of this plague reigning over the Churches of Chriſt then at this day; O how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have this plague rooted it ſelf in the hearts of the Lords people, that four years affliction will not yet fetch it out, but God will fetch it out of their hearts, or elſe he will fetch their bodies out of their warm houſes; beſides what a fearful ſpirit and plague of Apoſtaſie have their over-ſpread the minds of the Churches of Chriſt, I will not ſay this hath leavened every one, but ſure I am too many of them.</p>
                  <p>Then what cauſe have the Church and houſe of Chriſt to make to Chriſt with all haſte for cure, and were it the will of God, how could it be wiſhed that Chriſt our High Prieſt were more viſited upon this account by his people.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If any man had ſinned either ignorantly or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, the Prieſt upon his coming to him was to offer ſacrifice for him, and it was pardoned, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 17, 18. The ſame work is Chriſt to do for believers, for he is their High Prieſt for this very purpoſe ſaith the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, he is to make Reconciliation for the ſins of the people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. Its as much the mark and office of Jeſus Chriſt to do ſo for believers, as ever it was the work of the legal High Prieſts to do it for the Iſraelites, therefore ſoul, when ever thou haſt been over taken in a fault, do not fly from Chriſt, but away to him, for he is thy High Prieſt in Heaven on purpoſe to make an atonement for that ſin, and Reconciliation to God for that ſin; only when thou haſt been with Chriſt, believe that for his ſake it ſhall be pardoned, and the father will be pacified, and doubt not of it, it will be ſo, ſoul thou maiſt
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:93772:146"/> apply as really as the Jews that very word in <hi>Levit. 5. 18. And the Prieſt ſhall make an atonement for him concerning his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, wherein he erred and wiſt not, and it ſhall be forgiven him;</hi> to this agreeth the words of the Apoſtle in 1 John 2. 1, 2. <hi>If any man ſin we have an Advoca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e with the father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins in his own bloud, and not only for ours, but for the ſins of the whole world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The Prieſt was to interpoſe between Gods wrath, and the people in a time of ſin, and by his interceſſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pacifie God again, read <hi>Numb.</hi> 16 46, 47, 48. This is proper to Chriſt alſo, and it did but Type out Jeſus Chriſt in the great work of reconciling God to the creature, together with his preſent interceding work, whereby he ſtandeth to this hour between the Father and the Church, this ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> of our Saviour to <hi>Timothy, 1 Tim. 2. 5. There is but one God and one mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore when ever ſin and ſatan preſents the with an angry God for ſin, labour to affect thy heart with the thoughts of it; repent and be humbled about, but be not out of hope, look up to thy High Prieſt and there thou maiſt ſee him interpoſing between Gods anger and thy ſoul in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to pacification.</p>

               <p>THere was likewiſe an Ordinance of God inſtituted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews, which was this, a ſtanding ſacrifice of two Lambs which were to be offered to the Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening, the one in the Morning, and the other at Evening, every day throughout the year, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 38, 39. This was to be done whether the people could be there at the ſacrifice yea or no, which teacheth theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The continual ground which God ſtill hath in his eye, for the continuing his reconciling love to the Church, and that is the death of his Son, which is called the Lamb of God, <hi>John</hi> 1 29. Chriſt is called a Lamb as he was a ſacrifice to God for him.</p>
               <p>This ſacrifice which did at firſt fully give the Father ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for ſin is always in the eye of God, Chriſt preſents himſelf to the Father under that conſideration always; Therefore is it ſaid the mercy-ſeat was ſprinkled wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h the bloud of the ſacrifice, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 14, 15. That when ever the Father had any thing to do with the mercy-ſeat, there ſhould he always ſee the bloud of the Lamb Chriſt, which ſpeaketh better things then that of <hi>Abel, Heb</hi> 12. 24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It teacheth us this much, family-duty is to be kept up and maintained as an ordinance of God by all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Souls.</p>
               <p>This ſtanding ſacrifice had a double reſpect.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As it reſpected our Lord Jeſus, ſo it Typed out the conſtant voice of the bloud of Chriſt in the ears of God for everlaſting Reconciliation with the Elect, that as they were always ſinning, ſo here are two Lambs always ſacrificing
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:93772:147"/> before God for them: But ſecondly, as it reſpected the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo it was as the performance of family-duty by them, for they were (as it were) but one family, and they had one head to it which was <hi>Moſes,</hi> but at morning and at evening this practice of the ſacrificing of the Lambs muſt be kept up and performed throughout the year.</p>
               <p>O ſo much is it a duty for families to offer God the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Morning ſacrifice at this day as it was then. O methinks to conſider how little God is honoured in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect by the families of the earth, it is a matter moſt lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Certainly mens not performing family-duty is a ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of God from being King in that family; for God is known amongſt the families of the Earth by prayer, for God upon himſelf as having a ſpecial part of his Prerogative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him in that family which denies him family prayer, therefore is God ſtyled a God of prayer, and the God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer, and one unto whom all fleſh ſhall come; and indeed the contrary is threatned with a dreadful ſtroke (I mean the omiſſion of the duty) read <hi>Ier. 10. 25 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen, and the families which call not upon thy name:</hi> Men little know what ſecret miſchiefs they heap up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves and their families, who live in the open neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this duty, ſaith God in <hi>Deut. 32. 23. I will heap up miſchiefs upon their heads,</hi> I <hi>will ſpend mine arrows upon them.</hi> And who ſo likely to be the perſons upon whom God will heap miſchief, as prayerleſs perſons, if you compare this of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 23. with <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 22. Into what flames have God turned ſome mens houſes in one night over their heads, turning them and theirs into aſhes before the morning, which judgment might have been prevented had they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this duty the night before; O think upon this you prayerleſs ſouls, for fear leaſt God ruſh out upon you and tear you in pieces, and there be found none to deliver you out of his hands.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 36.</hi> Of the good land of Canaan which the people were to enter into after their forty years travels in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</head>
               <p>THis land was by St. <hi>Paul</hi> called their reſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 11. This land was the end of all their ſore travels and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry journyings, and great temptations; a land of delights, a land full of fatneſs, abounding with all manner of eaſe and plenty, a land flowing with milk and honey, where there was not any want of any good thing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9. This doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3 11. expreſs as a type of that Goſpel Kingdom of reſt and peace, which all the true Iſraelites ſhall certainly reſt and Centre in at laſt, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal. 58. 11. So that men ſhall ſay, Verily there is a reward for the righteous;</hi> ſo my Brethren, there is a <hi>Canaan</hi> (more glorious then <hi>Iſraels</hi> was) for believers to enter into, of which <hi>Canaan</hi> of old was the type, and as all things typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal under the Law, did fall ſhort in glory of the ſubſtance of that thing which it typed forth, ſo alſo will it be in this caſe. The <hi>Canaan</hi> in the Anti-type will infinitely excel (for glory and brightneſs) the <hi>Canaan</hi> in the type. Theſe two <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> typed out one another for theſe things, or in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For condition upon which the Subjects were to enter each place.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For the priviledges of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the place it ſelf, where this <hi>Canaan</hi> ſhall be into
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:93772:148"/> which all the faithful ſhall enter, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Gods reſt, or a reſt for the people of God; and that is, in this world upon this earth, for ſo was <hi>Canaan</hi> of old, it was in this world, upon this earth, I do not ſay that there is no other <hi>Canaan</hi> of glory for the Saints to enter, but do believe there is, and my hope is towards it; but I ſay that reſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 11. which he makes to agree to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> of old as the Anti-type of it, muſt be a reſt in this world upon this earth, and not any where elſe: And this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we conſider the conditions upon which each <hi>Canaan</hi> is promiſed or tendred, that of old, and this by the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. And that was upon a faithful following of the Lord believingly, in our Wilderneſs-condition, this was made the condition between God and the people for <hi>Canaan</hi> of old, ſo reaſons the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 3. 11. So I ſwear in my wrath they ſhould not enter into my reſt,</hi> ſo ver 18. <hi>And to whom ſware he that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, but to them which believed not;</hi> ſo that the condition between God and the people made <hi>Canaan</hi> of old their reward for ſticking cloſe to God in a way of dependency, during the time of all their Trials, Temptations, and Afflictions in the Wilderneſs; ſo likewiſe doth the Apoſtle make the ſame qualifications, a condition between God and his people touching this latter <hi>Canaan,</hi> and applies the matter ſo, <hi>Heb. 4. 1. Let us fear leſt a promiſe being left us any of us ſhould come ſhort through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now by coming ſhort of a Goſpel <hi>Canaan</hi> through a ſpirit of unbelief, the Apoſtle muſt mean (I ſay by <hi>Canaan</hi>) either the ultimate glory, or elſe a <hi>Canaan,</hi> or Kingdom of glory here below; that it cannot be the ultimate glory, for if we will maintain Election before time, then none of thoſe that were ever Elected to that <hi>Canaan</hi> can ever fall ſhort of it more: if Election be the fruit of the eternal purpoſe of God according to the counſel of his own will, ſo ſaith the ſpirit of our being Predeſtinated or Elected, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 11. In whom alſo we have obtained an Inheritance, being predeſtinated according
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:93772:148"/> to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things according to his own will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this will of God admits of no change, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaketh, <hi>Malachi 3. 6. Rom.</hi> 11. 29. And that it is his will that all thoſe he elected, or choſe to glory ſhall inherit, <hi>John</hi> 6. 39. Then certainly its not of the ultimate glory which the Apoſtle intends in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. but of a reſt much of this ſide that reſt which the Apoſtle makes to agree with Canaan of old, with reſpect to the conditions of it, upon which they were to be enjoyed. But if you underſtand by the (reſt) that Chriſt will have a glorious Kingdom or Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in this world, which he hath onely appointed for ſuch as have or ſhall follow him with faithfulneſs in this life where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth, as that none of all the Saints ſhall taſte of it, but ſuffering faithful ones; then according to this notion, the exhortation, in <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 4. 1. will hold with election and predeſtination, or elſe it will not; for we ſay that the Scriptures which ſpeaks of abſolute election and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination to a thing; which election and predeſtination is an abſolute fruit of Gods unchangeable councel and will; and yet to ſay that the ſame thing is conditional, as that if the conditions be not performed, the thing may not be, is to me ſo great a myſtery which cannot be unridled: But if we place it nere (as it muſt be to reconcile the point) that the ultimate Canaan of glory is a fruit of Gods abſolute will which cannot be altered: (Therefore ſaith our Saviour, thoſe which are appointed unto it ſhall never periſh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 28) And that there is a <hi>Canaan</hi> which the Saints (that are faithful to Chriſt) ſhall enjoy in this life, as for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of which (though the Elect cannot, any one of them fall ſhort of the promiſe of the ultimate glory) yet they may of this. This Doctrine will hold good in both ends without thwarting other foundation truths, and that this Kingdom of <hi>Canaan</hi> promiſed the ſuffering faithful Saints, muſt be (as I have ſaid) here below. I ſhall give you ſome Scriptures to prove it.</p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:93772:149"/>
               <p>But firſt you are to note, that our Saviour gives you to underſtand that there are two Kingdoms or <hi>Canaans</hi> which he makes to be diſtinct, the one from the other, one he calls his own, that is, its his by purchaſe and promiſe, as he is a Mediator and undertook to bring about Salvation to the Elect, as you may read in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11, 12. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 6. with ver. 8. I <hi>ſay our Saviour makes this Kingdom to be diſtinct from the fathers,</hi> read that place in <hi>Rev. 3. 21. To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, I will grant to ſit with me upon my Throne, even as</hi> I <hi>alſo have overcome, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne;</hi> ſo that you ſee here is the Son of mans Throne, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Throne, ſo <hi>Mat. 19. 28. And he ſaid, Verily</hi> I <hi>ſay unto you, that ye that have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory.</hi> Mark that, when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the Throne of his glory, there is the Son of mans Kingdom of glory, or <hi>Canaan</hi> of glory, as well as the Fathers: So in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. There is by the Holy Ghoſt two <hi>Canaans</hi> or Kingdoms of glory ſpoken of in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct manner one from the other, in ver. 4. <hi>And</hi> I <hi>ſaw Thrones, and they that ſate upon them, and judgment was given to them;</hi> which anſwers to that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 28. Which <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> or Kingdom you ſee is given as the to reward the Saints for their ſufferings for Chriſt, therefore in the ſame verſe its ſaid to be the portion of thoſe which were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhipped the beaſt or his Image, neither had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his mark upon their fore heads or in the hands, and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years.</p>
               <p>Now look you into the 11. ver. of the ſame Chap. And you ſhall ſee the Fathers <hi>Canaan</hi> or Kingdom very diſtinct from the former which was Chriſts, but by him given to the ſuffering Saints; <hi>And</hi> I <hi>ſaw a great white throne and him that ſate thereon, from whoſe face the Earth and the Heavens fled away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That this promiſed <hi>Canaan</hi> or Kingdom which is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 11. is called a reſt, muſt be here on Earth and in
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93772:149"/> this world, which will appear if you examine the Scriptures which ſpeak of it. To inſtance in that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. Its ſaid there, that in that <hi>Canaan</hi> Kingdom they ſhall ſit upon twelve Thrones Judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael; now how can this be applyed to the ultimate glory; if the Saints muſt ſit upon Thrones to Judge, then it follows there muſt be ſome to be judged, but if this be meant of Heaven, pray who ſhall the Saints Judge there, or who will there be in Heaven for them to Judge, ſo <hi>Rev. 2 26, 27. He that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end,</hi> I <hi>will give power over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and he ſhall rule them with a rod of Iron, and as the Veſſels of a Potter ſhall they be broken to pieces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now pray obſerve, how can this be applyed to the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate glory, what Iron Rods of ſeverity will there be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, beſide the Saints ſhall rule over the Nations; what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will there be in Heaven for the Saints to rule over, you read in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25 31, 32. with 41. That when the <hi>Canaan</hi> of ultimate glory comes to take place, that all the Nations ſhall be gathered together before God, and the Godly taken up into Heaven, and the wicked at the ſame time ſent away into eternal darkneſs: Now if the wicked muſt go down into Hell, at the ſame time that the Godly muſt be received up into Heaven, where then will the Nations be for the Saints to Rule over with Iron Rods, ſo in <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2. You are bid to pray for a Kingdom, ſaying, when thou prayeſt, ſay. <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> Now this very Kingdom muſt be on Earth, for is not the Kingdom of grace as the Kingdom of grace is commonly underſtood, becauſe the Kingdom of grace was then in being, and had been in being all along in all ages of the world before: But this Kingdom which Chriſt bids his Diſciples to pray for, was a Kingdom yet to come. <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> Neither can it be the Kingdom of glory, for that is not ſaid to come to us, but we are ſaid to be carryed up to it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17. Yea its ſo far from being the Kingdom of ultimate glory, that its a Kingdom which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth down out of glory upon the Earth, <hi>Rev. 20. 2, 3. And</hi>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:93772:150"/> I <hi>John ſaw the holy City, new Jeruſalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband, and</hi> I <hi>heard a great voice out of Heaven, ſaying, behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf will be with them, and be their God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This you ſee how <hi>Canaan</hi> of old, and this Goſpel <hi>Canaan</hi> (which the Apoſtle calls a reſt to the people of God) do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree for matter of place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are made to agree for the conditions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the ſubjects were to enter each place, faith was required as neceſſary to the entring of old <hi>Canaan, Heb.</hi> 3. 18, 19. The ſame is required as neceſſary to this Goſpel <hi>Canaan, Heb.</hi> 4. 1. Again, a following of God fully was required as neceſſary to enter the old <hi>Canaan, Numb.</hi> 14. 21, 22. 23, 24. The ſame is required as neceſſary to the entring of this Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They do agree for priviledges only in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>Canaan</hi> of old was a very pleaſant, delightful, good land, which afforded aboundance of comfort, wealth, and ſafety, a full reward for all their travels, temptations, and afflictions, which they went under for the Lord; ſo is it with this Kingdom or <hi>Canaan,</hi> much more full of glory will this be found to have.</p>
               <p>I ſhall briefly preſent you with ſome of the glory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of it in ſome few particulars. In the general it is ſet forth to you as a glorious thing, or a great piece of glory, <hi>Iſa. 60. 1. Ariſe for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee:</hi> But to be a little more particular about this Kingdom, and here we muſt take notice of theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Something done, or is to be done by Chriſt at the ſetting up of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Then the priviledges of it.</p>
               <p>But as to the firſt, there will be a general and total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction fall upon all the enemies of the Lord which ſhall be found in a way of hoſtile oppoſition againſt the ſetting of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:93772:150"/> this kingdom: for if you obſerve you may ſee how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming into <hi>Canaan</hi> doth agree to this particular, with reſpect to what the Scripture ſaith, ſhall be done upon the wicked at the ſetting up of this kingdom; for it is to be obſerved, that juſt before their entering into the good Land, the greateſt ſlaughter that ever was made of the enemies of the Lord was at that time, as you may ſee, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. This was but a type of what ſhall be the portion of the wicked, at the Saints entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their great Canaan priviledges: Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So <hi>Iſa. 63. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, Iſa. 66. 15, 16. Joel</hi> 3. 2. with 14. <hi>Revelations</hi> 19. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when this is done, and the great battle fought, and the Lord Jeſus hath ſtrook through the loins of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; then will he take their kingdoms from them, and give them unto the Saints in the whole world, made up of both Jews and gentiles, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. with <hi>Dan 7. 22. 27. Rev. 20 4. Matth. 19. 28. Rev.</hi> 2. 26, 27. In which Kingdom it is clear that the Saints ſhall rule the Nations of the earth, as the earth hath governed them for many years together in this world, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. 16</p>
               <p>The Kingdom being delivered up into their hands, then are they freed from the oppreſſion and the oppreſſour, which evil will never anoy the Saints more; the Lord will ſo much reſtrain and moderate the rage of the wicked, <hi>Iſa. 11. 6, 7, 8, 9. Iſa. 35. 9. Iſa 6. 18. Iſa.</hi> 54. 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Saints ſhall then in an eminent manner be a righteous holy people, no hypocrite ſhall be there, <hi>Iſa. 35. 8. Iſa. 60 21. Zach. 14. 20, 21. Revelations 22. 15. Revelations</hi> 21. 17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Saints ſhall be then ſet wholly free from a timmerous and diſtracting fearful ſpirit in duty, <hi>Zach. 12. 8. Iſa.</hi> 35. 4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Their knowledge in all divine as well as in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, will be wonderful, to the adminiſtration of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:93772:151"/> thoſe which ſhall have to do with them; yea, ſo great ſhall the wiſdom of the Saints be at that day, that thoſe perſons who have been accounted the learned and wiſe of the times before, ſhall be aſhamed to acknowledge that ever they were ſuch men, <hi>Zach. 13. 4. 5. Iſa.</hi> 29. 24.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There ſhall ſo great a ſpirit of fear and dread drop from their countenances upon the wicked, as that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry majeſty of their preſence will daunt them through the whole earth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6 10.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, There ſhall be a mighty ſpirit of glory upon all the attempts and atchievements which the Saints ſhall bring forth at that day, though now it be clothed with ſhame and diſgrace in the eyes of the world, yet then it ſhall ſeem otherwiſe, <hi>Iſaiah 54. 11, 12. Iſaiah 16. 14, 15. Iſaiah</hi> 66. 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, This Canaan ſhall afford the Saints all manner of riches, plenty, and peace, <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 60. 78. with 12. 13. <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Zach. 14, 14. Revel. 21. 7. Revelations 22, 2. Pſalm</hi> 72. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The very heavens and the earth ſhall receive their primitive excellency and firſt purities, <hi>Ezek. 34. 27. Iſa. 65. 17. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, In this Canaan God will ſo bleſs the ſubſtance of it, as that he will remove out of the way all theſe thorns and prickling briars which did any way render our comforts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to us, or did any way imbitter them to our taſte, as the ſhortneſs of life, God will take away that, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65. 20. with ver. 22.</p>
               <p>As likewiſe God will remove all occaſions of loſs, either as to goods or eſtate, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 21, 22, 23. Alſo all pains of body, or decrepidneſs of limbs, <hi>Iſa. 35. 5, 6. Revel. 21. 4. Revel.</hi> 22. 3.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, And that which will crown all will be this, they ſhall be under the conſtant ſhinings of Gods face of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous love and mercy, which will never admit of any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 4, 5.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:93772:151"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, doth not our Saviour ſay, <hi>That my kingdom is not of this world, 1 John</hi> 18. 36. and that the kingdom of heaven cometh not with obſervation, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 20. and that the kingdom of God is within you, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>How is it which you ſay, the kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be on earth in this world.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, That there is a three-fold kingdom which is attributed to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A kingdom of providence, or his providential king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And a kingdom of grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A kingdom of glory here on earth.</p>
               <p>As for his providential kingdom, of that I ſhall ſay but little.</p>
               <p>But there is his kingdom of grace in the heart. This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom cometh not with obſervation indeed, and this is not of this world; for nothing in the world can procure or effect it in the heart of any creature. The ſtrongeſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Philoſopher, or richeſt <hi>Nabal</hi> in the world, ſhould they put all their ſtrength, and parts, and riches together, can do nothing in this caſe, without the mighty power of God. This kingdom of grace is within in the heart indeed, and it affords no ſigns, or fore-running tokens of it in the leaſt: but as the winde bloweth where it liſteth, ſo is the ſpirits coming upon a ſoul at the time of its converſion; you hear the ſound of it, but know not from whence it is: ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 3. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>But thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dly, There is his glorious Kingdom, or Kingdom of Glory, and that is what is of this world; and that which cometh with ſigns and tokens of obſervation, that Chriſt is to have a Kingdom in this world, a Kingdom of external glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hath been the buſineſs which we have proved already: but for better ſatisfaction take this Scripture, <hi>Revel. 11. 15. And there were voices in heaven, ſaying, The kingdomes of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lords, and of his Chriſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the coming of this kingdom is with obſervation,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:93772:152"/> that is, its attended with its fore-running ſignes and tokens, there is nothing more clear: read <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. from the 1. ver. to the 30. You ſhall meet with little elſe but matter of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation touching the coming of this kingdome into the world, ver. 30. So that Chriſt ſaying, My kingdom is not in this world, and my kingdom cometh not with obſervation, and my kingdom is within you, doth not in the leaſt fight againſt this truth, if we conſider the various adminiſtrations of the Kingdom: I grant all this to be properly applied to the kingdom of his Grace, but not to the Kingdom of his Glory, which he ſhall have here, as he is the Son of man.</p>
               <p>Further, Now the Jews <hi>Canaan</hi> was an inheritance which God gave the people freely, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 1. So is it in this caſe, to have a right to this Kingdom, or Goſpel Canaan of reſt and peace, it is the free gift of God, without any deſert on our part at all: take the kingdom as it is of grace here in the heart, or of glory in the Nations, or of ultimate glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, to have a portion in it, its of free gift: therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luke 12. 32. Fear not little flock, it is your fathers good pleaſure to give you the kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe <hi>Canaan</hi> it was an inheritance which was divided to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> proportionably, to every one by lot, <hi>Numb.</hi> 26, 54, 55, 56. So is it in this caſe of the Goſpel Canaan, every true Iſraelite ſhall have his portion of grace and glory in this kingdom; none ſhall ſay then, that his field ſhall yield no meat, or that his flock be cut off the fold: no, no, but rather with <hi>David</hi> to cry out, <hi>Pſalm 16. 5, 6. The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup, thou main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt my lot, the lines are fallen in a pleaſant place; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, The Jews were to march in an armed ſtate to their <hi>Canaan</hi> of old: ſo ſhould all the Saints get on about them their ſpiritual armour, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Epheſ. 6. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Wherefore take on thr whole armour of God, that you may be able to withſtand in the evil day, and when you have done all to ſtand: ſtand therefore, having your loins girt about with

               </p>
               <p>Without this armour on about you, never think to march ſafe to this good Land, take it either for the kingdom of glory here on earth, or the kingdom of glory above with the Father. Your enemies are worſe then thoſe which ſtood in Iſraels way to their Canaan, ſaith <hi>Paul, Eph. 6. 12.

               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Jews were to fight for the good Land; they were not onely to put on their armour, but they were to uſe it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 So muſt Chriſtians, not onely put on their ſpiritual armour, but they muſt uſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devil, ſin, and temptation: Armour ſignifies but little if a man make no uſe of it; therefore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, 1 Tim. 6. 12. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, whereunto thou art called.</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, They were to fight under their captain <hi>Joſhua.</hi> So this ſheweth Chriſtians under whoſe banner they ſhould fight. and who they ſhould engage with them in the quarrel, their ſpiritual <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in whoſe ſtrength alone they are more then conquerors, <hi>Rom. 8. 37.

               </p>
               <p>Saints, your enemies are great and politick, and truly they contend with you for things of a very great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; its for your ſouls, things of more worth then the world; and in your ſelves you are poor weak things, but Chriſt is the power of God, yea, the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah:</hi> be ſure if you intend to overcome and prevail, get un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of Chriſts wing, ſet Chriſt before you, make

               <p>Theſe Cities, as to the uſe of them, they were all types of Jeſus Chriſt, with reſpect to the ſafety Chriſt adminiſters to poor guilty ſinners, in a way of protecting of them from the wrath of God.

               <p>But if the ſoul can make to Chriſt before the juſtice of God hath overtaken him, he will be ſafe; fot Chriſt is the great City of refuge; there is no kinde of evil can enter the gates of this City, ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov. 18. 10.

               <p>THere was likewiſe a live Goat, which that the Prieſt was to take, upon the head of which he was to lay his hands, and there to make a publick confeſſion to God of all the peoples ſins, and when ſo done, the Prieſt was to lay all the ſins of the people upon the head of the Goat; then was the Goat to be ſent away into the Wilderneſs, never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with them more, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 26. 7, 8. 9. with 21, 22. verſes.</p>
               <p>This Type as well as the reſt was to ſet forth the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful grace of God in Chriſt to ſinners, who hath prepared a ſcape Goat for them, to carry away their ſin upon his own head; which ſcape Goat is Chriſt, his onely Son.

               <p>THere were other Sacrifices which they offered to God, beſides what have been mentioned, all holding forth ſomething of a Chriſt to come; now theſe ſacrifices were of two ſorts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of things ſolid.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Of things liquid or moiſt.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſolid things which they offered to God in ſacrifice, they were likewiſe of two ſorts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of things living.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Of things dead.</p>
               <p>Now the living ſacrifices, or the ſacrifices of thoſe things that were living. They were either Bullocks, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 11. Goats, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 15. Rams, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 3. Lambs <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 3. And young Pigeons, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1 14.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe living ſacrifices were to be put to death,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93772:154"/> which anſwers to the death of Chriſt, pointed out to them, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb. 9. 26. That</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>towards the latter end of the world ſhould appear to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe ſacrifices were not only to be put to death, but their bloud was to be ſhed forth, that ſo an atonement might be made to God by it, <hi>Levit. 1. 14. Levit.</hi> 16. 15, 16. Which anſwers to that of the Apoſtle touching Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. And where as well theſe ſacrifices were to be without ſpot or blemiſh, <hi>Levit.</hi> 3. 6. This anſwers to the Apoſtles pure nature of our Goſpel-ſacrifice Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As for theſe ſacrifices which were of things ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid but of a dead matter, it was Meal or Flower, and this was to be bruiſed or broken, which anſwers to that of Chriſt, which the Prophet ſpeaks of him in <hi>Iſa. 53. 10. Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for theſe ſacrifices which were liquid, they were either of Oil, Wine, or Water; and this was to be poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29 40. Which anſwereth to that of Chriſt which the Prophet ſpeaks in <hi>Iſa. 53. 12. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus ſoul, I have ſpoken my thoughts of theſe great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel, and I hope that I was not wholly left to my own ſpirit; in the thing I found much of the preſence of the Lord going along with me in the work, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which was laid in priſon when I was ſhut up for Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My deſire is, that as I have laboured in the ſtrength of God to bring this forth for thy ſpiritual profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, thou wouldſt not content thy ſelf only with the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this piece in thy houſe, and the letting of it ſtand upon thy ſhielf, or to let it lie in thy window, but be much in the reading and meditation of it; things no farther profit us then we are diligent in the uſe of them.
